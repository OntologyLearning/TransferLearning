"'I am the Marconi Professor of Communications Systems in the Computer Lab, at the University of Cambridge, almost exactly 100 years after Marconi's ""groundbreaking"" first transatlantic wireless call, and i am a fellow of Wolfson College; a decade ago&more, i was a professor in the Department of Computer Science University College London. i graduated in Physics from Trinity College, Cambridge University in 1979. i got an MSc in Computing in 1981, and PhD in 1993 both from UCL. (before that i even went to primary and 2ndary school once). i'm a fellow of the Royal Society, the ACM, the British Computer Society, the IET the Royal Academy of Engineering and the IEEE. I'm a member of UCU and have been (or its equivalent) since 1979. Technical advisory boards i am on include MPI SWS, THLab, Netronome, IMDEA Networks, KAIST, Onelab & the Foundation for Information Policy Research Advisory Council. I'm also on the REF sub-panel for Computing and Informatics for my sins. My recommended reading lists + chic geek movies + misc advice. on tech. writing and speaking + role models. Family and other namesakes, e.g. John Crowcroft is not me, but is related, and does some fine art. Joss Crowcroft is also not me, but has done some cool software.",'1-3-2,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
