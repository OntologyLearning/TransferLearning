"'Load Balancing  The problem of load balancing on large networks is to find distributed algorithms that balance the load across the units of the network efficiently. Most of our work focuses on two popular communication models, the diffusion and the matching model. For both models, we analyze several iterative protocols that employ the idea of randomized rounding. We show that these protocols almost achieve the same discrepancy within the same number of rounds as their counterparts for the case of divisible load.",'1-2-2-4-1-1-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,I

"'Rumor Spreading  Randomized rumor spreading are simple epidemic protocols that spread one message (rumor) from one node to all other nodes. This is done by allowing nodes to exchange the rumor with a randomly chosen neighbor in each round. The main question is to determine the number of required rounds to spread the rumor to all nodes on different networks. Our research includes: (1) analyzing the rumor spreading time on different network models, e.g., social networks; (2) studying the relation to graph parameters such as vertex- or edge expansion; (3) understanding the randomness requirement of rumor spreading.",'1-2-2-4-1-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
