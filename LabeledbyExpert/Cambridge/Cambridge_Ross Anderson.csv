"'The GCHQ Protocol and its Problems pointed out a number of serious defects in the protocol that the British government used to secure its electronic mail, and which it wanted everyone else to use too. This paper appeared at Eurocrypt 97 and it replies to GCHQ's response to an earlier version of our paper. Our analysis stopped the protocol being widely adopted. The Global Trust Register is a book of the fingerprints of the world's most important public keys. It thus implements a top-level certification authority, but using paper and ink rather than electronics. DTI proposals for mandatory licensing of cryptographic services would have banned this book; that fact enabled me to visit Culture Secretary Chris Smith at a critical point in the crypto wars and get crypto policy referred to Cabinet when otherwise it would have remained the province of the civil servants.",'1-9-2-2-8,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
"'This was all part of a campaign that FIPR ran to limit the scope of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Originally this would have allowed the police to obtain, without warrant, a complete history of everyone's web browsing activity (as this would have been ‘communications data’); FIPR got the House of Lords to limit this to the identity of the machines involved in a communication, rather than the URLs of the web pages. But the RIP Act still made it into law and has had a number of the bad effects we predicted at the time.

Our lobbying got it amended to remove criminal sanctions for patent infringement and legal protection for devices such as RFID tags.

EDRI's first campaign was against the IP Enforcement Directive; afterwards FIPR and EDRI established a common position on intellectual property. Since then I have given evidence to the Gowers Review of IP and a parliamentary committee on DRM; however the lead UK NGO on IP nowadays is the Open Rights Group.",'1-9-2-2-16,2,1,0,1,0,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
"'My pro-bono work includes sitting on Cambridge's Research Ethics Committee and our Board of Scrutiny. From 2003-10 I say on Council, our governing body. I stood for election because of a proposal that most of the intellectual property generated by faculty members – from patents on bright ideas to books written up from lecture notes – would belong to the university rather than to its creator. There were already unpleasant incidents around IP (see for example Mike Clark's story here); to stop such things happening again, we founded the Campaign for Cambridge Freedoms. The final vote approved a policy according to which academics keep copyright but the University gets 15% of patent royalties.

"'Security engineering is not just concerned with infrastructure matters such as firewalls and PKI. It's also about specific applications, such as banking and medical record-keeping, and about embedded systems such as automatic teller machines and burglar alarms. It's usually done badly: it often takes several attempts to get a design right. It is also hard to learn: although there were good books on a number of the component technologies, such as cryptography and operating systems, there was little about how to use them effectively, and even less about how to make them work together. Most systems don't fail because the mechanisms are weak, but because they're used wrong.",'1-10-2-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
