"'My research interest is in the application of anatomically-based computational models to increase our understanding of respiratory physiology.

"'Respiratory modelling, in particular Physiome and VPH-related respiratory projects, has developed somewhat in the shadows of other physiological areas, such as cardiac and musculo-skeletal modelling.
