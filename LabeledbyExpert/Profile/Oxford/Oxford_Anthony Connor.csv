"'My current research interests revolve around the development and validation of computational models of angiogenesis and vascular tumour growth. Throughout my DPhil I have applied both continuum (PDE) and stochastic individual-based approaches to modelling angiogenesis and tumour growth. My research highlights the need for a rigorous approach to model code design in order to promote code reuse, understandability and reproducibility and, to that end, I have devoted some of my efforts towards developing an object-oriented framework for the development and implementation of hybrid multiscale models of vascular tumour growth. My DPhil project is being undertaken in collaboration with Hoffmann-La Roche who are providing a wealth of experimental images for model validation.",'1-2-1-2-1-2-1-1-1-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
