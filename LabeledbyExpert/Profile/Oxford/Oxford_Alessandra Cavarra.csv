"'Her main research interests reflect her teaching activity. In the past, she has produced a formal semantics to most of UML behavioral diagrams, built a tool to symbolically execute UML models, and forward engineer UML models into formal specifications. She is also involved in model-based testing, i.e. the definition of methods and tools to derive automatically test cases from models depicting important aspects of the system under test. In general, Alessandra is interested in formal methods and the integration of formal and semi-formal languages. She is a member of the Abstract State Machines (ASM) community.",'1-2-1-2-1-1-2-1-1-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
