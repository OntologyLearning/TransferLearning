"'I am a doctoral student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford working in the Verification Group. My supervisor is Joel Ouaknine. During my PhD I did software engineering internships at Google Research, NYC (summer 2013) and at Google Inc, Zurich (summer 2012). Before starting my PhD, I was an undergraduate at University of Oxford graduating in 2010 in Mathematics and Computer Science (1st class honours). I won silver medals at ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest and at International Olympiad in Informatics.",'1-2-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
