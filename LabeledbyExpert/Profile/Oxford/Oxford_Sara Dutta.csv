"'My research interests focus on using a combination of computer simulations and experiments to understand the mechanisms behind the initiation and maintenance of arrhythmias, and especifically the transition from VT to VF. I am particularly interested in the effects of ischaemia-induced electrophysiological changes on the occurrence of these arrhythmias. In my first year I did a combined computational and experimental study on the interpretation of optical mapping recordings in a globally ischaemic heart. We showed how dual wavelength optical mapping can be used to characterise the ischaemic border zone in rabbit hearts. During my second year I investigated the use of recent human cardiac ventricular action potential models in ischaemia. I am now working on whole human ventricle simulations of arrhythmogenesis during ischaemia.",'1-2-1-2-1-1-2-1-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I

'I graduated from Imperial College London in 2009 with a Beng in Computer Science. I then joined Oxford as a Systems Biology DTC student. The first taught course year provided a good foundation for the interdisciplinary PhD that I started in 2010 within the Computational Biology group (and more specifically the cardiac modelling group).,'1-2-1-2-1-1-2-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
