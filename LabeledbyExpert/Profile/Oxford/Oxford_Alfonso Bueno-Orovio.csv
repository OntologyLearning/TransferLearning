"', in the development of telecommunication networks and as Research & Development Manager. This was followed by a Postdoctoral position at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, under a research initiative funded by AIRBUS Operations for advanced shape optimisation applied to aeronautical design. In September 2010, I joined the Computational Biology Group at the Department of Computer Science at Oxford, as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Computational Cardiac Electrophysiology with Dr. Blanca Rodriguez, funded by the preDiCT project and later by Dr. Rodriguez’ MRC award. In February 2012 I joined the Oxford Collaborative Centre for Applied Mathematics, for the development of innovative frameworks for the description of electrical propagation in cardiac tissue.
