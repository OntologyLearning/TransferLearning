"'I am a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. I was previously a full professor in machine learning and artificial intelligence at the department of computer science of the University of British Columbia. There, I was also an adjunct professor of statistics, and cognitive systems. I received my PhD from Trinity College, Cambridge University in 2000 on Bayesian methods for neural networks. From 1999 to 2001, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley in the artificial intelligence group of Stuart Russell. I am a fellow of the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR) in the successful Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception program. I am an occasional entrepreneur: Zite, a big-data spin-off from my previous lab, has won numerous awards and was sold to CNN in 2011. Among my recent awards are a Distinguished Paper Award at the International Joint Conference on Artificial intelligence (IJCAI 2013), the 2012 Charles A. McDowell Award for Excellence in Research, and the 2010 Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS) Young Researcher Award.",'1-2-1-2-1-2-1-1-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
