However, the editorial board asks that the reviewer follow the instructions below and remember two things: a) the authors will read the reviews, so try to be constructive and polite, and b) try to be clear, as in almost all cases the authors will craft their future efforts on the reviewed work based on these comments.",'1-1-2-2-1-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,N
