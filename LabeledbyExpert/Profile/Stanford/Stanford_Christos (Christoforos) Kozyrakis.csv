"'Christos Kozyrakis is an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford University. He leads the multi-scale architecture & systems team (MAST), a research group that investigates hardware architectures, runtime management environments, system software, and programming models for systems ranging from cellphones to warehouse-scale datacenters. His current research focuses on resource efficient cloud computing, energy efficient multicore systems, and architectural support for security. Christos joined Stanford in 2002 after receiving a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley. His alma mater is the University of Crete in Greece. Christos' first name in full is ""Christoforos""...",'1-1-1-2-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,N
