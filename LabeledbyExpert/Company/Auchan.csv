The store was one of the first hypermarkets to open in the U.S. David Kaplan of the Houston Chronicle said ""it was fairly unusual and became something of a tourist attraction"" when it had first opened.",'1-1-2-1-2-2-3-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,I

"'Auchan's second Greater Houston location opened in southeast Houston in September 2000. Kaplan said ""Auchan had solid business its first years, but with only two stores in the country, the company lacked buying power and economy-of-scale advantages."" In January 2003 Auchan announced that both of its U.S. stores were making losses and were going to be closed; Auchan stated that it was instead going to concentrate its expansion in Asia and Europe. Auchan U.S.A. sold its first Houston location to Ho Enterprises. Lewis Food Town occupied about 110,000 square feet (10,000 m) of the space, with the rest of the space taken by other tenants. Kaplan said that by 2003, ""the Houston market is saturated with huge discounters and large grocery stores."" In addition, many similar stores, including an H-E-B Food and Drug Store, the Hong Kong Supermarket, a Sam's Club, and a Wal-Mart Supercenter had opened in proximity to the west Houston Auchan. In Europe zoning laws would prevent such a high concentration of similar stores. Kaplan further added that ""In Europe, shopping malls are not as prevalent as they are in America, and Auchan's everything-under-one-roof concept has greater appeal"" in Europe rather than in the United States. The second former Auchan remains unoccupied, but was used as a shelter for Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005 and Hurricane Ike victims in 2008 due to its large space.",'1-1-2-1-2-2-3-2-4,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,I
