"'Apple created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to the New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the ""Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,"" which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.",'1-1-2-1-2-2-2-2-2-2-1-1,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I

He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.",'1-1-2-1-2-2-2-2-2-2-1-2,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
