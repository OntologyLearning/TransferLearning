"'Interest rates on loans vary to a great extent but, being a public-owned bank that operates as a commercial venture, Banco do Brasil is not noted for having the highest, or the lowest rates either. Banco do Brasil is not the only Brazilian bank with high interest rates. The Economist ""Survey of International Banking"" of May 20, 2006 reports that the average Brazilian interest rate on credit cards is 222%, even though inflation is under control, expected to be 5% for 2006. Interest rates have decreased slowly, despite the Brazilian Central Bank recent policy of dropping standard interest rates (which were of 8.5% per month as of June 2009).",'1-1-2-1-2-1-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I

"'Being public-owned, Banco do Brasil must recruit workers through a public draft process, known as Concurso Público and work within strict norms of business. Due to the security which the public draft process provides working for Banco do Brasil is considered a desirable job in most of Brazil. This process is usually carried out separately for each region, with approved candidates being recruited to any branch in the region, in which they completed the process, within the following two years in order of classification (it can be delayed for more than two years, once in each process). Candidates must be Brazilian nationals (or legal residents and naturalised) and must be able to prove that they have completed their military service and electoral registration obligations (both military service and voter registration are mandatory for all Brazilians aged 18 to 70).",'1-1-2-1-2-3-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
