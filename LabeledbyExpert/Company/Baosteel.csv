"'Beginning in 1978, the Chinese government began to institute economic reforms. Plans called for a large integrated steel production facility to be located near the port of Shanghai. The Baoshan District, a suburb of Shanghai, was chosen as the site and Japanese assistance was enlisted in constructing one of the most modern steel plants of the time. As the government's flagship steel company, Baoshan Iron and Steel as it was originally called, benefitted from acquiring the best engineers and managers, access to cutting edge technology, and receiving hefty government contracts.",'1-1-2-4-1-2-2-1-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
"'Baoshan Iron and Steel also benefitted from the breakneck pace of Chinese economic expansion which ravenously consumed all the steel available. However, with the continuing liberalization of the Chinese economy, Baoshan found itself in competition with new rivals, both foreign and domestic. The company decided to add an export trade marketing component to remain competitive; it scored notable success in South Korea. Although hurt by the Asian financial crisis, Baoshan pushed through with a merger of other money losing state owned enterprises, though it had managed to remain profitable itself. On November 17, 1998, the former Baoshan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation absorbed the Shanghai Metallurgical Holding Group Corporation (上海冶金控股集团公司) and the Shanghai Meishan Group Co. (上海梅山集团公司) to form Shanghai Baosteel Group Corporation.
