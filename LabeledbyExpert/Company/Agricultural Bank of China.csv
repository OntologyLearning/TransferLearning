In 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank, and it was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979.
