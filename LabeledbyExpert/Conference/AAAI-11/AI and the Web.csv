"'The web has evolved from a simple hypertext standard into a ubiquitous, global information system including virtually all of human knowledge. Today's web provides ready access to not only text, images, and audio files, but also to structured and semistructured information, sensor data, composable services, and communities of people. It offers an open and decentralized environment in which anyone can publish information and services coupled with powerful search engines and agents to discover them. All of this is ubiquitously available from wired, wireless, and mobile devices. The result is an environment enormously useful to people for research, learning, commerce, socializing, communication, and entertainment. We have just begun to explore how this vast amount of machine accessible knowledge can be exploited and used by machines to better serve human needs as well as to discover new knowledge.",'1-2-2-1-2-1-1-2-2-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,N
