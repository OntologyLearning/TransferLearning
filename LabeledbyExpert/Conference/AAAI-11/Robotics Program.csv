"'The first Miniature Humanoid Obstacle Challenge was hosted at AAAI 2010 in Atlanta. The Challenge demanded a humanoid to reach a goal position on a 6-foot field that was cluttered with colored obstacles. Multiple rounds were held over the 3-days and received enthusastic audiences. The participants are collaborators on an NSF-sponsored project that works on simulated and miniature humanoids, respectively called virtual-Hubo and mini-Hubo. Based on the enthusiasm of the 2010 Challenge, we propose a Virtual Humanoid Manipulation Challenge. Here, virtual-Hubo will be provided to all those interested in participating. The simulated world will demand manipulation (for example, push gates, lift bars, and so on and whole-body motions (for example, pick up boxes, crawl under desks, and so on). The exciting element is that code developed for virtual-Hubo runs on mini-Hubo. This platform independence thus enables one to see outcomes from the simulation on a real miniature humanoid. As such, a real-world facsimile of the simulated world will be erected at AAAI 2011. Code from winning teams will be uploaded to our mini-Hubo and executed in the real world. The net effect is a challenge that is not limited by electromechanical hardware but opens the opportunity for many groups, to get involved with humanoid research, and see their work perform on a real humanoid.",'1-2-2-1-2-3-2-4-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,N
