"'The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference is a leading international forum for information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference seeks submissions from academia, government, and industry presenting novel research on all practical and theoretical aspects of computer and communications security. Papers should have relevance to the construction, evaluation, application, or operation of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing argument for the practical significance of the results. All topic areas related to computer and communications security are of interest and in scope. Accepted papers will be published by ACM Press in the conference proceedings. Outstanding papers will be invited for possible publication in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Information and System Security.",'1-2-2-1-2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,N
