"'To solve complex, real-world problems, AI systems often must integrate component technologies, such as planning, reasoning, language, dialogue, perception, goal-driven action, and learning. Prototypical examples of such integrated systems include software agents, multimodal user interfaces, autonomous robot systems, robots that interact with humans, intelligent tutoring systems, and virtual characters. The Integrated Intelligence track presents papers on issues that arise in the design and construction of such systems that include clear evidence for the efficacy of the integration.",'1-2-2-1-1-1-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,N
'Papers in this track highlight synergistic effects of integrating components from distinct areas of AI to achieve intelligent behavior. They articulate the innovative mechanisms used to combine multiple components and should demonstrate the synergy achieved through this integration. Topics may range from small-scale integrations of two components to large-scale efforts that support robust autonomous agents.,'1-2-2-1-1-1-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,N
