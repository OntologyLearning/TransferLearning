"'Abstract:  Computer-mediated human micro-labor markets allow human effort to be treated as a programmatic function call. Rather than thinking of ""employees"" when we design tasks, we can characterize these platforms as Human Processing Units (HPU). This is a first class computational platform, which is different from CPU based computation, and deserves careful characterization and study. We demonstrate that simple HPU computation can be more accurate than complex CPU based algorithms on some important computer vision tasks. We also argue that HPU computation can be cheaper than state-of-the-art CPU based computation. Finally we give some simplistic examples of characterizing the HPU.",'1-1-2-2-2-17-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
