<a name="submission"></a>
<br /><h3>Submission Information</h3>

Submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and
unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and
analysis should be included. Submissions will be judged on
correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, relevance
to the conference, and interest to the attendees.

<p>ACL-HLT 2011 will also accept papers accompanied by the resource
(software or data) described in the paper. In addition to the regular
review of the research quality of the paper, these papers will also be
reviewed for the quality of the resource that is being made
available.
Papers that are submitted with accompanying software/data will receive additional
credit toward the overall evaluation score, and acceptance or
rejection decision will be made based on the quality of both the
research and the software/data component.
<p>
ACL-HLT 2011 has the goal of a broad technical program. We invite papers in
the following four broad categories: theoretical computational
linguistics, empirical/data-driven approaches, resources/evaluation,
applications/tools. We also invite papers describing a challenge in the
field, position papers, survey papers, and papers that describe a negative
result.

<p>Submission is electronic using paper submission software at:

<!-- <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.softconf.com/acl2011/papers/">https://www.softconf.com/acl2011/papers/</a> -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>Long papers: https://www.softconf.com/acl2011/papers/</del>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>Short papers: https://www.softconf.com/acl2011/shortpapers/</del>

<p>NOTE: Before submitting your paper, please make sure you read the review forms
that will be used for the different paper categories.
<ul>
<li><a href="reviewforms/applications.txt">Applications / Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="reviewforms/empirical.txt">Empirical / Data-Driven</a></li>
<li><a href="reviewforms/resources.txt">Resources / Evaluation</a></li>
<li><a href="reviewforms/theoretical.txt">Theoretical</a></li>
<li><a href="reviewforms/other.txt">None of the above</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan to also submit a software package or a dataset along with the
paper, please upload the software/data in the submission form.


<h4>Long papers</h4>

<p>Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, with two
(2) additional pages of references, and will be presented orally or as
a poster presentation as determined by the program committee.  The
decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as
poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than on the
quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings
between full papers presented orally and those presented as poster
presentations. The deadline for long papers is December 17, 2010
(11:59pm PST).

<h4>Short papers</h4>

<p>Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, and two
(2) additional pages of references. Short papers will be published in
a separate volume, and will be presented orally or as a poster
presentations. The deadline for short papers is February 25th (11:59pm PST). The
following types of papers are appropriate for a short paper
submission:

<ul>
<li>A small, focused contribution</li>
<li>Work in progress</li>
<li>A negative result</li>
<li>An opinion piece</li>
<li>An interesting application nugget</li>
</ul>

<h4>Format</h4>

<p>Both long and short paper submissions should follow the two-column
format. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or
Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conference, which
are available on the conference website under Information for
Authors. Submissions must conform to the official ACL-HLT 2011 style
guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be
electronic in PDF.

<p>As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to
these requirements will be rejected without review.

<p>Authors that choose to also submit the supporting software/data with
their paper, will have to ensure that the resource is ready for
distribution, with complete README files and all the information
required so that the reviewers can evaluate and/or use at least a part
of the resource. The software/data component has to be anonymized for the review process.

The resource associated with papers being accepted for publication at ACL-HLT 2011
will be publicly distributed along with the online version of the
conference proceedings.


<h4>ACL-HLT 2011 Style Files</h4>

<p>Important: Remove authors information from your manuscripts when submitting them for blind review!

<h4>Multiple-submission policy</h4>

<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must provide this information at submission time. If
ACL-HLT 2011 accepts a paper, authors must notify the program chairs,
indicating which meeting they choose for presentation of their work.
ACL-HLT 2011 cannot accept for publication or presentation work that
will be (or has been) published elsewhere.

<br /><br /><h3>Mentoring Service</h3>

<p>ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from regions of
the world where English is less emphasized as a language of scientific exchange.
Many authors from these regions, although able to read the scientific literature
in English, have little or no experience in writing papers in English for
conferences such as the ACL meetings. If you would like to take advantage of the
service, please upload your paper in PDF format by November 1, 2010 using the
paper submission software for the mentoring service below. Questions about
the mentoring service should be referred to (tb at ldwin.net)
