<title>ACL HLT/EMNLP Call for Workshop Proposals, 2011</title>
</head><body>
<h1>CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS<br/>ACL HLT 2011 &amp; EMNLP 2011</h1>

<p> The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the ACL
Special Interest Group on Linguistic Data and Corpus-Based Approaches
to NLP (SIGDAT) invite proposals for workshops to be held in
conjunction with either the ACL HLT or EMNLP conferences in the summer
of 2011.  We solicit proposals on any topic of interest to the ACL and
EMNLP communities. Workshops will be held at one of the following
conference venues:</p> <ul>

<li> <b>ACL HLT 2011</b> is the 49th Annual meeting of the Association
  for Computational Linguistics. It will be held in Portland, Oregon,
  June 19-24, 2011.  The dates for the ACL HLT workshops will be June
  23-24.  The webpage for ACL HLT 2011 is: <a
  href="http://www.acl2011.org">http://www.acl2011.org/</a>.<p/>
  </li>

<li> <b>EMNLP 2011</b> is the conference organized by SIGDAT.  It will
  be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, July 27-31, 2011. The EMNLP workshops
  will be held July 30-31.  </li> </ul>

Proposals will be reviewed <i>jointly</i> by the workshop organizers
for both conferences.

<h2>SUBMISSION INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Similar to 2010, the submission and reviewing of workshop proposals
for ACL HLT and EMNLP will be coordinated.</p>

<p>Proposals for workshops should contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic and content.</li>
<li>The desired workshop length (one or two days), and an estimate of the number of attendees.</li>
<li>The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research
interests and areas of expertise.</li>
<!-- David's argument that the budget is redundant makes sense to me -->
<!-- <li>A budget.</li> -->
<li>A list of potential members of the program committee, with an indication of which members have already agreed.</li>
<li>A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop.</li>
<li>A description of special requirements for technical needs.</li>
<li>A note specifying which venue(s) (ACL HLT versus EMNLP) would be
acceptable to you; if both are acceptable, you may express preference
for one or the other.</li>
</ol>

There will be a single workshop committee, coordinated by the two sets
of workshop chairs. This single committee will review the quality of
the workshop proposals.  Once the reviews are complete, the workshop
chairs will work together to assign workshops to each of the two
conferences, taking into account the location preferences given by the
proposers.</p>

<p>The ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find 
the ACL's general policies on workshops at

<b>
<p>Please submit proposals in plain text
in the body of an email to <a href="mailto:acl.emnlp.workshops.2011
_AT_ gmail _DOT_ com _DOT_ nospam">the workshop organizers</a> no
later than <b>November 15, 2010, 23:59:59 UTC/GMT</b> (which is 18:59:59
EST, 15:59:59 PST, and 08:59:59 JST on Nov 16).
</p>
</b>

</p><p>Notification of acceptance of workshop proposals will occur no
later than December 5, 2010. Since the two conferences will occur at
different times, the timescales for the submission and reviewing of
workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be
different for each conference. Suggested timescales for each of the
conferences are given below.  Workshop organizers should not deviate
from this schedule unless absolutely necessary.</p>
