<FONT SIZE=4><B>Conference Presentation:</B></FONT>

<p>

Regular presentations will be allotted a 25-minute talk and up to 10 pages in
the proceedings. This format is intended for contributions reporting original
research, submitted exclusively to this conference.  Brief announcements will
be allotted a 10-minute talk and a 2-page abstract (each marked as a brief
announcement) in the proceedings. This format is a forum for brief communications,
which may be published later in other conferences.

</p>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Awards:</B></FONT>

<p>

Every regular paper is eligible for the best paper award.  The program
committee may decline to make this award or may split the award among
multiple papers.

</p>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Submissions:</B></FONT>

<p>

Authors of contributed papers are encouraged to submit their manuscript
electronically. More details will follow soon. The deadlines for electronic
submissions are <strong>January 12</strong> for regular papers and
<strong>January 19</strong> for brief announcements. These are <b>firm</b> deadlines.
No extensions will be granted. Authors who are unable to submit electronically
should contact the program chair, <A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/rraj/">Rajmohan Rajaraman</A>,
to receive instructions.  <em>Do not send electronic submissions to this email
address.</em>

<p>

Papers submitted to SPAA may not be under simultaneous consideration for a journal or any conference or workshop with published proceedings (other than as a brief announcement for a previous conference).

</p>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Paper Submission Format:</B></FONT>

<br>

The cover page should include
<ol>
  <li> title,
  <li> authors and affiliation,
  <li> postal and e-mail address of the contact author,
  <li> a brief abstract describing the content of the paper, and
  <li> an indication of whether this is a regular presentation or a brief announcement
</ol>
If requested by the authors, an extended abstract that is not selected
for a regular presentation will also be considered for the SPAA brief announcements.
Such a request will not affect the consideration of the paper for a
regular presentation.

<P>

Submissions of regular presentations should include the cover page followed by an
introduction understandable to a nonspecialist including motivation and previous
work, and a technical exposition directed to a specialist.  It should
not exceed 10 printed pages on letter-size paper in 11-point font or larger (excluding the
cover page, the figures and the references).  More details may be
supplied in a clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of the program
committee.

<p>

A submission for the SPAA brief announcements should be no longer than 3 pages (excluding the cover page) on letter-size paper using at least 11-point font.
</p>

<p>
For authors who are not sure about the right format, a simple Latex template can
be accessed <a href="template.tex">here</a>.
</p>


<FONT SIZE=4><B>Notification:</B></FONT>

<p>

Authors will be sent notification of acceptance or rejection by
e-mail or letter mailed on or before March 9.  A camera-ready copy of each
accepted abstract must be prepared according to the ACM guidelines for
