<h2>Submission format</h2>

<p>
All electronic submissions must be in PDF format and prepared for 8.5 x 11 inch paper (US letter size).
The cover page should include
<ol>
  <li> title,
  <li> authors and affiliation,
  <li> postal and e-mail address of the contact author,
  <li> a brief abstract describing the content of the paper, and
  <li> an indication of whether this is a regular presentation or a brief announcement
</ol> </p>
<p>
Submissions of regular presentations should include the cover page followed by an introduction understandable to a nonspecialist including motivation and previous
work, and a technical exposition directed to a specialist.  It should
not exceed 10 pages in 11-point font or larger (excluding the
cover page and the references).  More details (such as figures and proofs) may be supplied in a clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of the program
committee. Submissions for the SPAA brief announcements should be no longer than 3 pages (excluding the cover page) on letter-size paper using at least 11-point font. Papers significantly deviating from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
