<p>The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence is pleased to present, in conjunction with the AAAI-11 Conference in San Francisco, California, the The Second Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-11), to be held August 9&ndash;10, 2011.</p>

<p>EAAI-11 provides a venue for researchers and educators to discuss pedagogical issues and share resources related to teaching AI and using AI in education across a variety of curricular levels (K&ndash;12 through postgraduate training), with a natural emphasis on undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning. The symposium seeks contributions showing how to more effectively teach AI, as well as how themes from AI may be used to enhance education more broadly (for example, in introductory computing courses or as a means for teaching computational thinking). We encourage the sharing of innovative educational approaches that convey or leverage AI and its many subfields: robotics, machine learning, natural language, computer vision, and so on.</p>
<p>The EAAI-11 proceedings will be published by AAAI Press as a section within the AAAI-11 Conference Proceedings.</p>

<h4 class="text2">Paths for Participation</h4>
<p>EAAI-11 provides several paths for participation, including the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Full-length papers (6 pages) and presentations for the symposium</li>
	<li>Extended abstract/poster contributions (2 pages) highlighting preliminary or ongoing work, or describing an educational innovation proposed to be presented in a demonstration session</li>
	<li>A Model AI Assignments session highlighting innovative, ready-to-adopt materials</li>
	<li>A workshop for mentoring new faculty, instructors, and graduate students on teaching</li>
	<li>An Educational Video Track within the AAAI-11 Video program</li>
	<li>A Student/Educator Track within the AAAI-11 Robotics Exhibition and Workshop</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="text2">Submission Topics</h4>

<p>EAAI-11 welcomes paper submissions on a variety of topics, including, but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Educational resources, including syllabi, assignments, project ideas, and pedagogical strategies, related to teaching AI</li>
	<li>Multidisciplinary curricula highlighting the application of AI in other contexts (computational biology, algorithmic game theory, computational economics, and so on) and / or foundational concepts of AI in other fields (philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, psychology)</li>
	<li>The use of robotics and other tangible media both in AI courses and elsewhere in the curriculum</li>
	<li>Software that assists the teaching and learning process &mdash; everything from software to help visualize search spaces and search algorithms, to software substrates that can be used by students to do projects</li>
	<li>Resources and strategies for teaching specific AI subareas or topics: machine learning, robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, game playing, and many others</li>
	<li>Strategies for appropriately situating AI within a wider computer-science curriculum</li>
	<li>Ways to incorporate or address popular entertainment and media portrayal of AI (in movies, news, advertisements, new products, and so on)</li>
	<li>Real-world examples of successful AI deployments, described in sufficient detail to provide case studies and / or serve as useful springboards for other teachers</li>
	<li>Innovative means for integrating research as part of coursework in AI</li>
</ul>
	
<p>Ideally, full-length submissions to EAAI-11 should describe well developed ideas and/or pedagogical examples, and should include an evaluation of the work. Papers describing the use of robotics in the classroom should focus on evaluable pedagogical benefits of their use, and should be clearly differentiated from papers in the AAAI-11 Robotics program.</p>

<h4 class="text2">Abstract and Paper Submission</h4>

<p>Electronic abstract and paper submission through the <a href="http://eaai11.confmaster.net">EAAI-11 paper submission site</a> is required on or (preferably) before the deadline dates listed above. We cannot accept submissions by e-mail or fax.
</p>
<p>Papers must be in trouble-free, high resolution PDF format, formatted for US letter (8.5" x 11") paper, using type 1 or TrueType fonts. Papers may be no longer than 6 pages (full papers) or 2 pages (poster papers) including references, and formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style (see the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">author instructions page</a>). Please note that these formatting instructions are for final, accepted papers; no additional pages can be purchased at the review stage. In addition, the copyright slug may be omitted in the initial submission phase. Please also refer to the <a href="(http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2011/aaai11blind.php">blind-review webpage</a> for instructions on how to prepare your paper for blind review.
</p>
<p>Authors will receive confirmation of receipt of their abstracts or papers, including an ID number, shortly after submission. AAAI will contact authors again only if problems are encountered with papers. Inquiries regarding lost papers must be made no later than February 27, 2011.
</p>
<p><i>Submissions to Other Conferences or Journals:</i> Papers submitted to this conference must not have been accepted for publication elsewhere or be under review for another AI conference. The guidelines of the AAAI policy on multiple submissions are fully detailed below and must be carefully followed.
</p>
<p>Review Process: Program committee members will identify papers they are qualified to review based on the information submitted electronically (the paper's title, keywords, and abstract). Their reviewing will be done blind to the identities of the authors and their institutions.
</p>
<p>Authors will have a limited opportunity to respond to initial reviews. This author's feedback may then be taken into account in the final reviews and recommendations. The program committee's reviews will make recommendations to the senior program committee, which in turn will make recommendations to the program cochairs. Although the program cochairs will formally make all final decisions, in practice almost all will be made earlier in the process.
</p>
<p><i>Publication:</i> Accepted full papers will be allocated six (6) pages in the conference proceedings. Up to two (2) additional pages may be used at a cost to the authors of US$ 275 per page. Accepted extended abstracts (poster papers) will be allocated two (2) pages in the conference proceedings. Up to one (1) additional page may be used at a cost to the authors of US$ 275. Final poster papers exceeding three (3) pages and those violating the instructions to authors will not be included in the proceedings. Authors will be required to transfer copyright of their paper to AAAI.
</p>
<h4 class="text2">EAAI-11 Model AI Assignments Session</h4>


<p>As previously noted, EAAI-11 will feature a special session on Model AI Assignments suitable for use in a variety of class settings.

<div class="hr1"><hr /></div><h3 class="text2">AAAI-11 Policy Concerning Submissions to Other Conferences or Journals</h3><p>Papers submitted to this conference must not have been accepted for publication elsewhere or be under review for another AI conference. (The AAAI Nectar paper submissions have specific guidelines that can be found in that call for papers.)</p><p>To encourage interdisciplinary contributions, AAAI will consider work that has been submitted or presented in part elsewhere, if it is unlikely to have been seen by more than a few members of the AAAI audience. As such, papers may not be dually submitted to other AI or AI subarea conferences. Papers under submission to a journal that contain overlap with AAAI papers will be considered as long as the author specifies the dual submission and certifies that the journal submission contains significant material that is not included in the AAAI submission. Papers that have been published in full in another conference or journal will not be accepted for review. Novelty is an important criterion in the selection of papers.</p><p>AAAI requires the following:</p><ol><li>Authors must specify the conferences and journals to which the paper has been dually submitted.</li><li>Authors must withdraw papers under review or accepted for other AI conference venues if the paper is submitted to AAAI.</li><li>Papers not dually submitted should so indicate on the title page.</li></ol><p>For questions as to whether a given meeting is considered under the dual submission policy, or for clarifications of this policy, submitters should contact the Program Chairs.</p><div class="hr1"><hr /></div>
