    <p><strong>Industry Event: Call for Papers</strong><br />
 <br />
This year’s CIKM conference will include an Industry Event, which will be held during the regular conference program in parallel with the technical tracks.</p>
<p>The Industry Event's objectives are twofold. The first objective is to present the state-of-the-art in information retrieval, knowledge management, databases, and data mining, delivered as keynote talks by influential technical leaders who work in industry. The second objective is to present interesting, novel and innovative industry developments in these areas.</p>
<p>Industry authors are invited to prepare proposals for presenting interesting, novel and innovative ideas, and submit these to <a href="mailto:industry@cikm2011.org">industry@cikm2011.org</a> by June 21st 2011. The proposals should contain (with respective lengths):</p>
<ul>
<li>Short company portrait (125 words)
</li><li>Short CV of the presenter (125 words)
</li><li>Title and abstract of the presentation (250 words)
</li><li>Reasons why the presentation should be interesting to the CIKM audience
</li></ul>
<p>When submitting a proposal, please bear in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the presentation is relevant to the CIKM audience (the Call for Papers gives a good idea of the conference scope).
</li><li>Try to highlight interesting R&amp;D challenges in the work you present. Please do not present a sales pitch.
</li><li>All slides will be made public (no confidential information on the slides; you will be expected to ensure your slides are approved by your company before being presented).
</li><li>Presenters may opt to have their presentation videoed and made public, and if so, the presenter will be asked to sign a release form.
</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to receiving your submissions, and welcoming you to the CIKM 2011 Conference and Industry Event.</p>
<p><strong>Important dates:</strong><br />
21 June 2011:		Industry Event paper proposals due<br />
19 July 2011:		Notifications sent<br />

<p><strong>Industry Event Keynotes</strong><br />
CIKM 2011 is proud to present a series of invited talks by distinguished industry speakers.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Robertson, Microsoft Research</strong><br />
<img src="/sites/default/files/ser2010_small.jpg" alt="ser2010_small.jpg" title="ser2010_small.jpg" width="130" height="158" class="inline" /><br />
Stephen Robertson joined Microsoft Research Cambridge in April 1998. At Microsoft, he works with other IR researchers on core search processes such as term weighting, document scoring and ranking algorithms, combination of evidence from different sources, and with metrics and methods for evaluation and for optimisation. The grouping is part of a group called Online Services and Advertising, and works closely with product groups to transfer ideas and techniques.</p>
<p>In 1998, he was awarded the Tony Kent STRIX award by the Institute of Information Scientists. In 2000, he was awarded the Salton Award by ACM SIGIR. He is the author, jointly with Karen Sparck Jones, of a probabilistic theory of information retrieval, which has been moderately influential. A further development of that model, with Stephen Walker, led to the term weighting and document ranking function known as Okapi BM25, which is used in many experimental text retrieval systems.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Microsoft, he was at City University London, where he retains a position as Professor Emeritus in the Department of Information Science.</p>
<p><strong>John Giannandrea, Google</strong><br />
<img src="/sites/default/files/giannandrea_small.jpg" alt="giannandrea_small.jpg" title="giannandrea_small.jpg" width="128" height="170" class="inline" /><br />
John Giannandrea leads the Freebase project, an open database of knowledge which anyone can contribute to. Freebase was created by Metaweb Technologies, which John founded and which was acquired by Google in 2010. Prior to Metaweb, John co-founded Tellme Networks and was the chief technologist of Netscape’s browser group where he contributed to many industry standards including HTML, HTTP, SSL, Java and RDF.  John is originally from Scotland and graduated from Strathclyde University, Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Hammerbacher, Cloudera</strong><br />
<img src="/sites/default/files/hammerbacher_small.jpg" alt="hammerbacher_small.jpg" title="hammerbacher_small.jpg" width="125" height="188" class="inline" /><br />
Jeff Hammerbacher is a founder and the Chief Scientist of Cloudera. Jeff was an Entrepreneur in Residence at Accel Partners immediately prior to founding Cloudera. Before Accel, he conceived, built, and led the Data team at Facebook. The Data team was responsible for driving many of the applications of statistics and machine learning at Facebook, as well as building out the infrastructure to support these tasks for massive data sets. The Data team produced open source projects such as Hive and Cassandra and their work was recognized at conferences such as CHI, ICWSM, SIGMOD, and VLDB. Before joining Facebook, Jeff was a quantitative analyst on Wall Street. Jeff earned his Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Harvard University. He recently served as a Contributing Editor for O'Reilly's "Beautiful Data" and currently serves as a Director of Sage Bionetworks.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Jackson, Thomson Reuters</strong><br />
<img src="/sites/default/files/jackson_small.jpg" alt="jackson_small.jpg" title="jackson_small.jpg" width="140" height="140" class="inline" /><br />
Peter Jackson is chief scientist at Thomson Reuters with responsibility for corporate Research and Development, a group of over 40 scientists in New York and Minnesota.  He is a seasoned technology executive with a background that includes three decades of experience in R&amp;D, half of which has been spent in the online information business. His group's specialty lies in the design and delivery of innovative platforms and novel solution components for document retrieval, text categorization and information extraction technologies. Peter studied Human Psychology at the University of Aston in Birmingham and completed his PhD at the University of Leeds.  Subsequently, he taught in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh University, and has held a number of adjunct faculty positions.  His current interests include data mining, social media, and vertical search.</p>
