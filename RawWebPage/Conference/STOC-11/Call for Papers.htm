    <b>The 43rd ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~dsj/stoc11/stoc11.html">STOC 2011</a>)</b>, sponsored by the ACM Special Interest
Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (<a href="http://www.sigact.org/">SIGACT</a>), will be held in San Jose, California,
from <b>Monday June 6 </b>to <b>Wednesday June 8, 2011, </b>as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (<a href="http://www.acm.org/fcrc/">FCRC</a>). Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of
computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include: algorithms and data structures,
computational complexity, cryptography, computational learning theory, computational game theory, parallel and distributed
algorithms, quantum computing, computational geometry, computational applications of logic, algorithmic graph theory and
combinatorics, optimization, randomness in computing, approximation algorithms, algorithmic coding theory, algebraic computation, and theoretical aspects of areas such as networks, privacy, information retrieval, computational biology, and databases. Papers that broaden the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important
problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged.</p>
<p>
    <b>Submission format:</b> Submissions
should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper; each author's name, affiliation, and email
address; and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. This should
be followed by an extended abstract of up to 10 pages, which consists of a scholarly exposition of the paper's main ideas, results, and techniques, including
motivation and a clear comparison with related work. The extended abstract should be addressed insofar as possible to a broad spectrum of CS Theory researchers. Authors should also substantiate the main mathematical claims of the paper with proofs, some of which may be placed in
  a clearly marked appendix that will be read at the discretion of the program committee. (Authors may simply attach a copy of the full paper as the appendix.) The body of the extended abstract (excluding title page, bibliography, appendix, and figures) should not exceed 10 single-spaced
  pages on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper, and should be in single-column format, using at least 1 inch
margins, 11-point font, and ample spacing all around. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.</p>
<p><b>Submission Instructions:</b> Authors are required to submit their extended abstracts electronically, in
  PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). The submission server will be available by October 4 through the
  following link: <a href="https://secure.iacr.org/websubrev/stoc2011/submit/">https://secure.iacr.org/websubrev/stoc2011/submit/</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>On-line Posting:</strong> Authors are  encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible on-line repository such as the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, <a href="http://www.eccc.uni-trier.de/">ECCC</a>, or the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/">Cryptology ePrint archive</a>. (Papers that are not written well enough for public dissemination are probably also not ready for submission to STOC.) We expect that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available by the camera-ready deadline. (This should be done in a manner consistent with the ACM Copyright Policy.)</p>
<p>
    <b>Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:</b> The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Abstract material which has been previously published in another conference proceedings
or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to July 2011, will not be considered for acceptance at
STOC 2011. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same)
abstract material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may interact with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions.</p>
 
<h3>Dates:</h3>
<p>
    <b>Extended Abstract Submission:</b> Thursday November 4, 2010 (4:59pm EST).
    <br />
        <b>Notification:</b> by email on or before February 3, 2011.
    <br />
        <b>Deadline for accepted papers:</b> A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 24, 2011.<br />
        <b>Welcome Reception:</b> Sunday June 5, 2011. <br />
      <b>Conference:</b> Monday June 6 - Wednesday June 8, 2011.<br />
      <strong>Full FCRC:</strong> Saturday June 4 - Saturday June 11, 2011.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Presentation of Accepted Papers:</b> One author of each accepted paper will be expected to present the work
at the conference.
</p>
 
<p>
    <b>Best Paper Award:</b> The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as
STOC Best Papers. Every submission is automatically eligible for this award. Rules for the award can be
found at <a href="http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/bestpaper">http://www.sigact.org</a><a href="http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/bestpaper">/Prizes/bestpaper</a>.</p>
<p>
    <b>Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:</b> A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored
paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors
are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility,
check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found at
<a href="http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/student/">http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/student/</a>.</p>
