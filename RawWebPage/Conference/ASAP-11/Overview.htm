	<h2>Welcome to ASAP 2011</h2>

	<p>The 22nd IEEE International Conference on
	  Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors
	  will take place in Santa Monica, California, a beautiful
	  coastal town in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area, rich in
	  cultural, entertainment, and outdoor attractions.</p>

	<p>The history of the event traces back to the International
	  Workshop on Systolic Arrays, organized in 1986 in Oxford,
	  UK. It later developed into the International Conference on
	  Application Specific Array Processors. With its current
	  title, it was organized for the first time in Chicago, USA
	  in 1996. Since then it has alternated between Europe and
	  North-America.</p>

	<p>The conference will cover the theory and practice of
	  application-specific systems, architectures and
	  processors. Areas for application-specific computing are
	  many and varied. Some sample application areas include
	  information systems, signal and image processing, multimedia
	  systems, communication, high-speed networks, sensor
	  networks, compression, graphics, cryptography, and many
	  areas of computational science. Aspects of
	  application-specific computing that are of interest include,
	  but are not limited to:</p>
	
	<ul class="bullets">
	  <li>Application-specific systems: network computing,
	    special-purpose systems, performance evaluation, design
	    languages, compilers, operating systems, nanocomputing
	    systems and applications, hardware/software integration
	    and rapid prototyping.</li><br>
	  
	  <li>Application-specific architectures: special-purpose
	    designs, design methodology, CAD tools, fault tolerance,
	    specifications and interfaces, networks-on-a-chip,
	    hardware/software co-design, processor arrays, SoC,
	    superscalar, multithreaded, VLIW and EPIC
	    architectures.</li><br>

	  <li>Application-specific processors: digital signal
	    processing, computer arithmetic, reconfigurable/custom
	    computing, implementation methodologies, new technologies,
	    fine-grain parallelism, FPGAs, low-power designs and
	    asynchronous hardware.</li>
	</ul>
