<h3>
Brief Biography</h3>
Professor McCluskey worked on electronic switching systems at the Bell
Telephone Laboratories from 1955 to 1959. In 1959, he moved to Princeton
University, where he was Professor of Electrical Engineering and Director
of the University Computer Center. In 1966, he joined Stanford University,
where he is Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as
well as Director of the Center for Reliable Computing. He founded the Stanford
Digital Systems Laboratory (now the Computer Systems Laboratory) in 1969
and the Stanford Computer Engineering Program (now the Computer Science
MS Degree Program) in 1970. The Stanford Computer Forum (an Industrial
Affiliates Program) was started by Dr. McCluskey and two colleagues in
1970 and he was its Director until 1978.
<p>Professor McCluskey developed the first algorithm for designing combinational
circuits - the Quine-McCluskey logic minimization procedure as a doctoral
student at MIT. At Bell Labs and Princeton, he developed the modern theory
of transients (hazards) in logic networks and formulated the concept of
operating modes of sequential circuits. His Stanford research focuses on
logic testing, synthesis, design for testability, and fault-tolerant computing.
Prof. McCluskey and his students at the Center for Reliable Computing worked
out many key ideas for fault equivalence, probablilistic modelling of logic
networks, pseudo-exhaustive testing, and watchdog processors. He collaborated
with Signetics researchers in developing one of the first practical multivalued
logic implementations and then worked out a design technique for such circuitry.
<p>Dr. McCluskey served as the first President of the IEEE Computer Society.
He is the recipient of the 1996 IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award. He is a Fellow
of the IEEE, AAAS, and ACM; and a member of the NAE. He has honorary doctorates
from the University of Grenoble and Bowdoin College. He has published several
books including two widely used texts.
