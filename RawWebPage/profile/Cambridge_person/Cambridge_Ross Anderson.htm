<H2>Economics and Psychology of information security</H2></a>

<P>

As systems scale globally, incentives start to matter as much as technology.
Systems break when the people who could fix them are not the people who suffer
the costs of failure. So it's not enough for security engineers to understand
cryptomathematics and the theory of operating systems; we have to understand
game theory and microeconomics too. This has led to a rapidly growing interest
in &lsquo;security economics&rsquo;, a discipline I helped to found. This
discipline is starting to embrace dependability and software economics; at the
other end, it's growing through bevaioural economics into the psychology of
security. I maintain

<H2>Peer-to-Peer and social network systems</H2></a>

<P>

Since about 2000, there has been an explosion of interest in peer-to-peer
and ad-hoc networking. One of the seminal papers was <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/eternity/eternity.html">The Eternity 
Service</a>, which I presented at Pragocrypt 96. I had been alarmed by the 
Scientologists' success at closing down the <a 
href="http://www.december.com/cmc/mag/1997/sep/helmers.html">penet</a> remailer 
in Finland, and have more than once been <a 
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/24/citibank_gags_crypto_researchers/">threatened</a>
by lawyers who did not want me to comment on the security of their clients'
systems.  Yet the modern era only started once the printing press enabled
seditious thoughts to be spread too quickly and widely to ban. But when books no
longer exist as tens of thousands of paper copies, but as a file on a single
server, will government ministers and judges be able to unpublish them once
more? (This has
since <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4181935,00.html">happpened
to newspaper archives in Britain</a>.) So I invented the Eternity Service as a
means of putting electronic documents beyond the <a 
href="http://www.fepproject.org/">censor's grasp</a>.  The Eternity Service 
inspired second-generation censorship-resistant systems such as <a 
HREF="http://cs1.cs.nyu.edu/~waldman/publius/">Publius</a> and <a 
HREF="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/">Freenet</a>; one descendant of these 
early systems is <a href="http://www.wikileaks.com/">wikileaks</a>. Our main
contribution nowadays lies in helping to maintain <a 
href="http://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the anonymity service used by 
wikileaks and by many others.

<P>
But the biggest deal turned out to be not sedition, or even pornography, but
copyright. Hollywood's action against <a
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> led to our ideas being
adopted in filesharing systems. Many of these developments were described <a
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/059600110X/rossandersshomep/103-4378804-8750205">here</a>,
and discussed at conferences like <a
HREF="http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/">this one</a>. See also
Richard Stallman's classic, <a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">The Right to Read</a>.
Many of the ideas in early peer-to-peer systems reemerged in the study of ad-hoc
and sensor networks and are now spilling over into social networking systems.

<H2>Reliability of security systems </H2></a>

I have been interested for many years in how security systems fail in real
life. This is a prerequisite for building robust secure systems; many security
designs are poor because they are based on unrealistic threat models. This work
began with a study of automatic teller machine fraud, and expanded to other
applications as well. It provides the central theme of my <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">book</a>. I also have a

Hidden Data Transmission Using Electromagnetic Emanations</a> must be one of
the more unexpected things we discovered. It is <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST">well known</a> that eavesdroppers
can reconstruct digital information such as video screen content from stray
radio frequency emanations; such `Tempest attacks' were traditionally prevented
by shielding, jammers or physical distance. We discovered that the software on
a computer can control its stray electromagnetic emanations. To attack a
system, malware can hide stolen information in signals that leak and optimise
them for some combination of reception range, receiver type or even covertness.
To defend a system, a screen driver can display sensitive information using 
fonts which minimise emitted RF energy. This technology was fielded in PGP and 
elsewhere. You can download Tempest fonts from <a

the DVD/SDMI copyright marking scheme was pulled by its authors from the  <a 
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021214055146/http://www.cert.org/IHW2001/">Information 
Hiding 2001</a> workshop, following legal threats from Hollywood. In fact, the 
basic scheme &ndash; echo hiding &ndash; was among a number that we broke in 
1997. The attack was reported in our paper <a

Civil servants started pushing for online access to everyone's records in 1992

Association on the safety and privacy of clinical information systems. Back
then, the police were given access to all drug prescriptions, after the
government argued that they needed it to catch doctors who misprescribed
heroin. The police got their data, but they didn't
catch <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Shipman">Harold Shipman</a>,
and no-one was held accountable. The NHS slogan in 1995 was `a unified electronic patient record, accessible to
all in the NHS'. The BMA campaigned against this, arguing that it would destroy
patient privacy:

Supreme Court</a> allowed a woman to block access to her father's 
records because of the information they may reveal about her (see <a

This effectively killed the vision of having the whole population on a database.
I also wrote an <a

System Security &ndash; Interim Guidelines</a> appeared in the British Medical
Journal on 13th January 1996. It advises healthcare professionals on prudent
security measures for clinical data. The most common threat is that private

</UL> <P>

In 1996, the Government set up the Caldicott Committee to study the
matter. Their <a href="http://confidential.oxfordradcliffe.net/caldicott/report/">report</a>
made clear that the NHS was already breaking confidentiality law by sharing
data without consent; but the next Government
just <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/ukpga_20010015_en_1">legislated</a>
(and <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/draft/20029890.htm">regulated</a>,
and <a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/20030043.htm">again</a>) to
give itself the power to share health data as the Secretary of State saw
fit. (We <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/fiprmedconf.html">objected</a>
and pointed out
the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/hcbillc67.pdf">problems the
bill could cause</a>; similar sentiments were expressed in
a <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/322/7284/442">BMJ editorial</a>,

claimed the records were needed for cancer registries: yet cancer researchers

and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/blobel2.pdf">here</a>.)
There was a storm of protest in the press: see
the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4126033,00.html">Observer</a>,
the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.co.uk/200102190016.htm">New Statesman</a>,
and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/7/17567.html">The
Register</a>. But that died down; the measure has now been consolidated
as <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/60041-af.htm#251">sections 251
and 252 of the NHS Act 2006</a>, the Thomas-Walport review blessed nonconsensual
access to health records (despite FIPR <a 
href="http://www.fipr.org/080215datasharing.pdf">pointing out that this was
illegal</a> &ndash; a view later supported by the European Court). A government
committee, the <a href="http://www.nigb.nhs.uk/">NHS Information Governmance 
Board</a>, was set up oversee this lawbreaking, and <a
href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/02/dame-fiona-caldicott-to-lead-confidentiality-review/">Dame Fiona</a> is being wheeled out once more. Centralised, 
nonconsensual health records not only contravene the I v Finland judgement but

Two health IT papers by colleagues deserve special mention. <a 
href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/318/7194/1328">Privacy in clinical 
information systems in secondary care</a> describes a hospital system
implementing something close to the BMA security policy (it is described in 
more detail in a special issue of the <a href="http://jhi.sagepub.com/">Health 
Informatics Journal</a>, v 4 nos 3-4, Dec 1998, which I edited). Second, <a 
href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/matyas/XTR_HIJ_draft.pdf">Protecting Doctors' 
Identity in Drug Prescription Analysis</a> describes a system designed to 
de-identify prescription data for commercial use; although de-identification
usually does not protect patient privacy very well, there are exceptions, such
as here. This system led to a court case, in which the government tried to stop
its owner promoting it &ndash; as it would have competed with their (less 
privacy-friendly) offerings. The government lost: the Court of Appeal <a 
HREF="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j149/civ_211299.htm">decided</a> 
that personal health information can be used for research without patient 
consent, so long as the de-identification is done competently.

<P>
I chair the <a HREF="http://www.fipr.org">Foundation for Information Policy
Research</a>, the UK's leading Internet policy think tank, which I helped set
up in 1998. We are not a lobby group; our enemy is ignorance rather than the
government of the day, and our mission is to understand IT policy issues and
explain them to policy makers and the press. Here's an <a 
href="politics.html">overview</a> of the issues as we saw them in 1999, and a <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEXSGDJEHSI&feature=PlayList&p=20CA8F634E15C85C&playnext=1&index=6">video</a>
of how we saw them ten years later in 2008. Some highlights of our work follow.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><strong>Privacy</strong> has become a big theme recently thanks to the <a
href="http://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Communications_Data_Bill">Communications
Data Bill</a>, against which we have been <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/sfs-2012.html">organising resistance</a>.
In the last parliament, our <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/database-state.pdf">Database 
State</a> report on the failings of public-sector IT in Britain, and how to fix
them, got massive press coverage: the <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7955205.stm">BBC</a>, the <a 
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/23/dna-database-idcards-children-index">Guardian</a> (also <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/mar/24/children-databases">here</a>), the <a 
href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1163958/Britains-database-state-breaches-human-rights-wastes-billions-pounds-say-academics.html">Mail</a> (also
<a 
href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1164291/ROSS-CLARK-As-report-condemns-government-databases--Big-Brother-wasting-billions.html">here</a>), 
the <a
href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/quarter-of-uks-databases-are-illegal-1651718.html">Independent</a>, the <a
href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/5032994/One-in-four-government-websites-illegal.html">Telegraph</a>, <a
href="http://www.ehiprimarycare.com/news/4680/call_to_scrap_%27illegal%27_nhs_patient_database">E-Health Insider</a> and <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/23/database-public-sector-it">Liberty Central</a>. This followed an earlier report on <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/kids.pdf">children's databases</a>,
and the many other activities described <a href="#Med">above</a>. Both main 
opposition parties promised to kill or change at least some of these systems, 
and after they won power in the 2010 election their coalition agreement spelled
the end of the ContactPoint children's database, and of ID cards. The subsequent
<a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/munroreview/">review</a> by my FIPR 
colleague Eileen Munro also sealed the fate of eCAF, another central children's
database system.</LI>

<LI><strong>Waste of Public Money</strong> is another objection to the bad
government systems that undermine our privacy. Other wasteful systems include <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SmartMetering-Feb82012.pdf">smart
meters</a> which look set to cost billions without achieving anything useful (<a
href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2012/09/17/the-perils-of-smart-metering/">blog</a>).</LI>

<LI><strong>Identity Cards</strong> were a clever political move by Blair; they 
divided the Conservatives in 2004-5.  I <a 
href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmhaff/uc130-iv/uc13002.htm">testified</a>
to the Home Affairs committee in 2004 that they would not work as advertised,
and contributed to the <a 
href="http://is2.lse.ac.uk/IDcard/identityreport.pdf">LSE Report</a> that
spelled this out in detail. I'd produced numerous previous pieces in response
to government identity consultations, on aspects such as <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/cards.html">smartcards</a> and <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/signaturedoc.html">PKI</a>. There's more 
in my <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">book</a> (ch. 6).</LI>

<LI><strong>Internet Censorship</strong> is a growing problem, and not just in
developing countries; I've been on the  <a 
href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2010/12/25/a-merry-christmas-to-all-bankers/">receiving end</a> more than once. In 1995, I invented the first
censorship-resistant system, the <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/eternity/eternity.html">Eternity
Service</a>; this was a precursor of later file-sharing systems (see <a
href="#Peer-to-Peer">above</a>), and we've also written on <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/redblue.pdf">the economics of
censorship resistance</a>. But despite the technical difficulties and
collateral costs of content filtering, governments aren't giving up. From 2006
to 2008, I was a principal investgator for the <a
href="http://www.opennetinitiative.net/">OpenNet Initiative</a> which monitors
Internet filtering worldwide. <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/index07borders.pdf">Shifting
Borders</a> reviewed the state of play in late 2007, and appeared in <a
href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2007/12/18/index-on-censorship-shifting-borders/">Index 
on Censorship</a>; <a 
href="http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/Deibert_04_Ch03_057-072.pdf">Tools 
and Technology of Internet Filtering</a> goes into more technical detail and
appeared in <a href="http://opennet.net/accessdenied">Access Denied</a>. The
political action now is about <a
href="http://www.cleanternet.org/">Internet blocking</a>.</LI> 

<LI>
<strong>Consumer Protection:</strong> FIPR also brought together legal and computing 
experts to deconstruct the fashionable late-1990s notion that &lsquo;digital 
certificates&rsquo; would solve all the problems of e-commerce and e-government.
Anyone inclined to believe such nonsence should read <a
HREF="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2000_3/bohm/">Electronic
Commerce &ndash; Who Carries the Risk of Fraud?</a>. Other work in this thread 
include FIPR's responses to consultations on <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/cards.html">smartcards</a>, the <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/signaturedoc.html">electronic signature 
directive</a> and the <a href="http://www.fipr.org/library/fipr.html">ecommerce
bill</a>. </LI>

<LI>More recently we have been alarmed at the erosion of consumer rights as a
result of the introduction of chip and PIN cards. The technical sections <a
href+"">above</a> describe how frauds happen; the flip side of the story is how
the banks escape liability. Our <a
href="http://www.fipr.org/080116huntreview.pdf">analysis of the failings of the
Financial Ombudsman Service</a> remains unanswered; see also FIPR's submission
on <a href="http://www.fipr.org/061023security.pdf">Personal Internet 
Security</a> (with which the House of Lords basically <a
href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2008/07/08/personal-internet-security-follow-up-report/">agreed</a>) 
and the <a 
href="http://www.fipr.org/080204payments.pdf">National Payments Plan</a>. FIPR
now takes the  <a
href="http://www.fipr.org/090730jackson.pdf">view</a> that the only way to fix
consumer protection is to replace public action with private action, by changing
the rules on costs so that consumers can enforce their rights in court without
risking horrendous costs orders if they lose.</LI>

<LI><strong>The RIP Act, the Crypto Wars and Key Escrow:</strong> I got engaged
in technology policy thanks to attempts in the 1990s by governments (led by the
USA) to control the use of cryptography. In 1995, I wrote <a 
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/queensland.pdf">Crypto in Europe 
&ndash; Markets, Law and Policy</a>. This surveyed the uses of cryptography in
Europe and discussed the shortcomings of crypto policy; I pointed out that law
enforcement communications intelligence was mostly about traffic analysis and
criminal communications security was mostly traffic security. This view was
heretical at the time but is now orthodoxy. <a 
href="http://www.crypto.com/papers/escrowrisks98.pdf">The Risks of Key Recovery,
Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption</a> became the most widely-cited
publication on key escrow. It examines the technical risks, costs, and 
implications of deploying systems that would satisfy government wishes. It was 
originally presented as testimony to the US Senate, and then also to the <a 
href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmtrdind/648/64802.htm">Trade
and Industry Committee</a> of the UK House of Commons, together with a further
piece I wrote, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/dtiselcom.html">The
Risks and Costs of UK Escrow Policy</a>.</LI>

<LI> <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/euroclipper.pdf"> The GCHQ
Protocol and its Problems</a> pointed out a number of serious defects in the <a
href="http://archive.opengroup.org/public/tech/security/pki/casm/casm.htm">protocol</a>
that the British government used to secure its electronic mail, and which it
wanted everyone else to use too. This paper appeared at Eurocrypt 97 and it
replies to GCHQ's response to an <a 
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/euroclipold.pdf">earlier
version</a> of our paper. Our analysis stopped the protocol being widely
adopted. <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/Security/Trust-Register/index.html">The
Global Trust Register</a> is a book of the fingerprints of the world's most
important public keys. It thus implements a top-level certification authority,
but using paper and ink rather than electronics. DTI proposals for mandatory
licensing of cryptographic services would have banned this book; that fact
enabled me to visit Culture Secretary Chris Smith at a critical point in the
crypto wars and get crypto policy referred to Cabinet when otherwise it would 
have remained the province of the civil servants. </LI>

<LI>
This was all part of a campaign that FIPR ran to limit the scope of the <a 
HREF="http://www.fipr.org/rip/">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act</a>. 
Originally this would have allowed the police to obtain, without warrant, a
complete history of everyone's web browsing activity (as this would have been
&lsquo;communications data&rsquo;); FIPR got the House of Lords to limit this to
the identity of the machines involved in a communication, rather than the URLs
of the web pages. But the RIP Act still made it into law and has had a number of
the bad effects we predicted at the time. See for example
an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/25/jfl_ripa_opinion/">op-ed</a>
I wrote on the history of the Act following
the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/24/ripa_jfl/">unfortunate
imprisonment</a> of a mentally-ill man under the Act for refusing to hand over
his PGP passphrase when the Met's terror squad told him to.</LI>

<LI>These issues have come round once more with GCHQ's <a
href="http://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Intercept_Modernisation">Interception
Modernisation Programme</a>, a plan to centralise all traffic data first in a
central database and more recently in a system of federated databases maintained
by communications service providers. FIPR wrote a <a
href="http://www.fipr.org/090722imp.pdf">response</a> to a Home Office 
consultation on this, and another <a
href="http://www.fipr.org/090714rip.pdf">response</a> to one on the orders and
codes of practice for interception. We also <a
href="http://www.fipr.org/egov-framework.pdf">commented</a> on the Cabinet
Office's (actually GCHQ's) inappropriate proposals to secure government systems.

</LI>

<LI><strong>Terrorism:</strong> A page with <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/wtc.html">Comments on Terrorism</a> 
explains why many of the measures that various people have been trying to sell 
since the 11th September attacks are unlikely to work as promised. Much 
subsequent policy work has been made harder by assorted salesmen, centralisers,
rent-seekers and chancers talking about terror; I <a
href="http://www.fipr.org/terrorismdetention.pdf">testified</a> against police
attempts to increase pre-charge detention to ninety days with the implausible
claim that they needed more time to decrypt seized data. We must constantly <a
href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/comment/story/0,,1801768,00.html">push 
back</a> on the scaremongers; here for example is a <a
href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=YEXSGDJEHSI">video</a> I did on the effects
of 9/11.</LI>

<LI><strong>Export Control:</strong> In 2001-02, FIPR persuaded the Lords to 
amend the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/exportbill.html">Export 
Control Bill</a>. This bill was designed to give ministers the power to license 
intangible exports. It was the result of US lobbying of Tony Blair in 1997; 
back then, UK crypto researchers could put source code on our web pages while
our US colleagues weren't allowed to. In its <a
href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldbills/060/2002060.htm">original
form</a>, its provisions were so broad that it would have given ministers the 
power of pre-publication review of scientific papers. We defeated the Government
in the House of Lords by 150-108, following a hard campaign &ndash; see press 
coverage in the <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1938000/1938218.stm">BBC</a>,
the <a
href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1944-uk-bill-would-infringe-scientists-freedom.html">New
Scientist</a>, the <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/feb/21/administration.highereducation1">Guardian</a>
and the <a
href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1021301">Economist</a>, and an <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/spectrum.html"> article on free 
speech</a> I wrote for IEEE Computing. But the best quote I
have is also the earliest. The first book written on cryptology in English, by 
Bishop John Wilkins in 1641, remarked that  <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/wilkins/wilkins.html">&lsquo;If all those 
useful Inventions that are liable to abuse, should therefore be concealed, 
there is not any Art or Science which might be lawfully profest&rsquo;</a></LI>

<LI>
This issue revived in 2003, with a government attempt to wrest back using <a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/ukcrypto/2003-April/025262.html">
regulations</a> much of what they conceded in parliament. FIPR <a
href="http://www.fipr.org/exportcontrol/030430consult.html">fought back</a> 
and extracted <a
href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo031216/text/31216-09.htm">assurances 
from Lord Sainsbury</a> about the interpretation of regulations made under the 
Act. Without our campaign, much scientific collaboration would have become 
technically illegal, leaving scientists open to arbitrary harrassment. Much 
credit goes to the Conservative frontbencher <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_Miller,_Baroness_Miller_of_Hendon">Doreen
Miller</a>, Liberal Democrat frontbencher <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sharp,_Baroness_Sharp_of_Guildford">Margaret
Sharp</a>, and the then President of the Royal Society <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_May,_Baron_May_of_Oxford">Bob May</a>,
who made his maiden speech in the Lords on the issue and marshalled the 
crossbenchers. We are very grateful for their efforts.</LI>

<LI><strong>Trusted Computing</strong> was a focus in 2002-03. I wrote a <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tcpa-faq.html">Trusted Computing FAQ</a>
that was very widely read, followed by a <a

companies, and issuing implementation guidelines. Trusted Computing appears to
have fizzled out because Microsoft couldn't get remote attestation to work; the

<LI><strong>IP Enforcement:</strong> Our top priority in 2003-04 was the <a 
href="http://www.fipr.org/copyright/draft-ipr-enforce.html">EU IPR enforcement
directive</a>, which has been succinctly described as <a 
href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,39118164,00.htm">DMCA on
steroids</a> and <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/cornish.pdf">criticised</a> by
distinguished lawyers. Our lobbying got it <a 
href="http://www.itworld.com/Man/2683/031128epcommittee/">amended</a> to remove
criminal sanctions for patent infringement and legal protection for devices such
as RFID tags. This law was supported by the <a 
href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39115498,00.htm">music industry</a>, 
the luxury brands, and (initially) Microsoft, while the coalition that we 
put together to oppose it included the phone companies, the supermarkets, the
generic drugmakers, the car parts industry, smaller software firms and the free 
software community. The press was sceptical &ndash; in <a
HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3250075.stm">Britain</a>, <a 
HREF="http://www.transfert.net/a9540">France</a> and even <a
HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/business/worldbusiness/20lobby.html">America</a>. The issue was even linked to a <a
HREF="http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2003/08/275818.html">boycott of
Gillette</a>. There is more on <a 
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/blog04.html#ipred">my blog</a>.</LI>

<LI> This was a watershed in copyright history: the IP lobby was never going to
be stopped by fine words, only by another lobby pushing in the other direction,
and the Enforcement Directive was when that first came together. It also led to
the birth of <a href="http://www.edri.org">EDRI</a>, European Digital Rights, a
confederation of European digital-rights NGOs, whose establishment was one of
FIPR's significant achievements. EDRI's first campaign was against the IP 
Enforcement Directive; afterwards FIPR and EDRI established a <a 
href="http://www.edri.org/campaigns/copyright">common position on intellectual 
property</a>. Since then I have given evidence to <a 
href="http://www.fipr.org/Gowers_IP_submission.pdf">the Gowers Review of IP</a>
and a <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/apig.pdf">parliamentary
committee on DRM</a>; however the lead UK NGO on IP nowadays is the <a

on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Council">Council</a>,
our governing body. I stood for election because of a proposal that most of the
intellectual property generated by faculty members &ndash; from patents on
bright ideas to books written up from lecture notes &ndash; would belong to the
university rather than to its creator. There were already unpleasant incidents
around IP (see for example Mike Clark's
story <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2003-04/weekly/5938/18.html">here</a>);
to stop such things happening again, we founded the <a

Freedoms</a>. The final <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/ccf-unpublish.html">vote</a>
approved a policy according to which academics keep copyright but the University
gets 15% of patent royalties. I got <a

in my second term we <a

<P>
Security engineering is about building systems to remain dependable in the face
of malice, error or mischance. As a discipline, it focuses on the tools, 
processes and methods needed to design, implement and test complete systems, 
and to adapt existing systems as their environment evolves. My book has become 
the standard textbook and reference since it was published in 2001. You can 
download the first edition without charge <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/book.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.

<P>
Security engineering is not just concerned with infrastructure matters such as 
firewalls and PKI. It's also about specific applications, such as banking and 
medical record-keeping, and about embedded systems such as automatic teller 
machines and burglar alarms. It's usually done badly: it often takes several 
attempts to get a design right. It is also hard to learn: although there were 
good books on a number of the component technologies, such as cryptography and
operating systems, there was little about how to use them effectively, and even
less about how to make them work together. Most systems don't fail because the 
mechanisms are weak, but because they're used wrong.

<P>
My book was an attempt to help the working engineer to do better. As well as
the basic science, it contains details of many applications &ndash; and lot of
case histories of how their protection failed.  It describes a number of
technologies which aren't well covered elsewhere. The first edition was pivotal
in founding the now-flourishing field
of <a HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/econsec.html">information security
economics</a>: I realised that the narrative had to do with incentives and
organisation at least as often as with the technology. The second edition
incoporates the economic perspectives we've developed since then, and new
perspectives from the psychology of security, as well as updating the
technological side of things.

<P>
I only referee for open publications, so I discard emails asking for reports 
for journals that sit behind a paywall.  I also usually discard emails sent by
people's secretaries: if you can't be bothered to email me yourself, then I
can't be bothered to answer myself either.

<P>If you want to do a PhD, please read our <a 
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/phd/">web pages</a> first; we get lots
of CV spam which we delete. I also discard emails that ask for internships; we 
can't employ overseas students on Tier 4 visas any more. If you're interested 
in coming as an undergrad, have a look at our <a
