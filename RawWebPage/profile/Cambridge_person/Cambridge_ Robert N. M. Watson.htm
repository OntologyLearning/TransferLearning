<p>I am a University Lecturer in Systems, Security, and
Architecture in the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/">Security Research Group</a>
at the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Laboratory</a>.
I lead a number of cross-layer research projects spanning computer
architecture, compilers, program analysis, program transformation, operating
systems, networking, and security.
Current projects include <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/">CTSRD</a>, a project
in collaboration with <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/">SRI International</a>
looking at clean-slate hardware and software designs for security.
This includes the <a href="#beri">BERI</a> and <a href="#cheri">CHERI</a>
processor designs, and <a href="#soaap">SOAAP</a> and <a href="#tesla">TESLA</a>, software analysis and transformation systems based on
LLVM.
I also have active research projects in network-stack performance, tracing,
and switching.
Recent completed projects include the <a href="#capsicum">Capsicum hybrid
capability system</a>, <a href="#concurrency-vulnerabilities">system-call
interposition concurrency problems</a>, and the <a href="#access-control">TrustedBSD MAC Framework</a>, a widely deployed OS
access-control extensibility framework (now found in FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Apple
iOS, Junos, and other products).
I have strong interests in open-source software, am on the board
of directors of the <a href="http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org">FreeBSD
Foundation</a>, and have contributed extensively to the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD Project</a>.

<dd><p>We are pleased to announce that the CTSRD Project has had two papers on
  recent work accepted: one on CHERI's memory protection model, which will
  appear at ISCA 2014 in June; a second on TESLA that will appear at EuroSys
  2014 in March.  Papers will appear online as the conferences arise;
  citations can be found <a href="#publications">below</a></p></dd>

<dt>October, 2013</dt>
<dd><p>David Drysdale (Google) has announced <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/linux.html">port of
  Capsicum to Linux</a> with the intent of upstreaming to the Linux
  kernel.  This follows on news of a <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/dragonflybsd.html">port
  to DragonFlyBSD</a> sponsored by Google Summoer of Code.
  We are also eagerly awaiting news of the release of FreeBSD 10.0, which
  includes <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/">Capsicum</a>
  enabled by default, a nice tidy up to the Capsicum API by Pawel Jakub
  Dawidek under contract to the FreeBSD Foundation (jointly sponsored by
  Google), and a moderate number of interesting base-system applications using
  Capsicum by default, including tcpdump, ktrace, hastd, and auditdistd.
  An exciting Autumn for Capsicum!</p>

  <p>Ilias Marinos, Mark Handley (UCL), and I will present a paper at
  HotNets-XII arguing that network-stack specialisation is required in order
  to fully utilise current hardware.  We demonstrate a clean-slate network
  stack (based on Luigi Rizzo's Netmap framework in FreeBSD) able to server
  web content at 3.5x the performance of FreeBSD and Linux using nginx,
  saturating six 10gbps NICs on a modestly configured contemporary server
  system.</p></dd>

<p>I lead a number of research projects spanning the security, computer
architecture, and network + operating system research groups at the Computer
Laboratory, supported by DARPA and Google.
A theme spanning many of my current research areas is the tension between
program representation and security, with interests in revising the
hardware-software interface, and whole-system implementation of security.
Several of these projects are part of the DARPA-sponsored <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd">CTSRD Project</a> in
collaboration with Peter G. Neumann at the <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/">Computer Science Laboratory at SRI
International</a>.
We also have a second joint DARPA project, MRC2, which is applying many of
these ideas in a distributed setting.
</p>

<p>I have additional research interests in the interplay between concurrency and
security, operating system access control (especially as relates to software
pplication compartmentalisation and capability systems), multi-threaded
network stacks, and revisiting a variety of hardware-software interfaces in
support of security, networking, and operating system design.
Utilising and improving open source platforms for research plays a key role in
technology transition for my work.
</p>

<h3 id="cheri">Capability hardware enhanced RISC instructions (CHERI)</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri.html">CHERI
processor</a> provides hardware-assisted in-process sandboxing based on a
hybrid capability model.
The goal is to support several orders of magnitude greater numbers of
sandboxes than current ISAs support -- while still maintaining compatibility
with current software designs.
</p>

<h3 id="beri">Bluespec experimental RISC implementation (BERI)</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/beri.html">Bluespec
experimental RISC implementation</a> is a new platform for research into the
hardware-software interface.
Consisting of a 64-bit MIPS ISA FPGA soft core implemented in the Bluespec
Hardware Description Language (HDL), a port of the FreeBSD operating system,
Clang/LLVM, and a conventional BSD/Apache-licensed software stack, we hope to
use BERI to explore a range of new experimental research directions spanning
the historically disjoint hardware and software research communities.
CHERI is the first search research project.
</p>

<h3 id="tesla">Temporally enhanced security logic assertions (TESLA)</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/tesla.html">Temporally
enforced security logic assertions (TESLA)</a> provide compiler-generated
run-time instrumentation continuously to continuously validate complex (temporal)
security properties, such as check-before-use, eventual audit, and network
protocol state machines.
</p>

<h3 id="soaap">Security-oriented analysis of application programs (SOAAP)</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/soaap.html">Security-oriented
analysis of application programs (SOAAP)</a> provides automated program analysis and
transformation technqiues to help software developers deploy <em>application
compartmentalisation</em> on sandboxing frameworks such as Capsicum and CHERI.
</p>

<h3 id="capsicum">Capsicum: practical capabilities for UNIX</h3>

<img src="capsicum.png" style="float:left;" width="90" />
<iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="252" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/raNx9L4VH2k" style="float:right; margin-left:2em; margin-right:1em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-top:0em;" width="448"></iframe>

<p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/">Capsicum:
  practical capabilities for UNIX</a>: In this work, we developed the notion of
  a <i>hybrid capability model</i>, blending ideas from research capability system
  security with commodity UNIX operating systems.  Capsicum is intended to support
  application and library compartmentalisation through extensions to the POSIX API.
  A key concern in Capsicum is incremental adoption --- we have a long-term vision
  for capability-oriented security, but wanted to provide a short-term technology
  adoption path addressing immediate security problems without introducing
  fundamental incompatibilities (an assumption in prior OS capability systems).
  Capsicum will appear in FreeBSD 9.0; patches are available for OpenBSD, and there is a
  work-in-progress port of Capsicum to Linux by Google.</p>

<br clear="all" />
<h3 id="concurrency-vulnerabilities">Exploiting concurrency vulnerabilities in system call wrappers</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.watson.org/~robert/2007woot/">Exploiting concurrency
  vulnerabilities in system call wrappers</a>: historically, a number of operating
  system vendors, researchers, and third-party security vendors (such as anti-virus
  vendors) have relied on system call interposition to augment the OS security
  model.  In this work, I explored inherent concurrency vulnerabilities that exist
  in the model.  We now teach this as an exercise to our Part II security students,
  who must exploit vulnerabilities in Systrace to deface a web site.
</p>

<h3 id="access-control">Operating system access control extensibility (MAC
  Framework)</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.TrustedBSD.org/">The TrustedBSD Project</a>: brought
  features traditionally limited to "trusted" operating systems into open
  source, including mature security event auditing, extensible kernel access
  control in support of mandatory access control access control (MAC), and
  discretionary access control (DAC) extensions such as access control lists
  (ACLs).
  These features have been adopted by a number of vendors including the
  FreeBSD Project, in Apple's Mac OS X and iOS operating systems, Juniper's
  JunOS, McAfee's Sidewinder firewall, and others.
  My February 2013 <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2408776.2408792&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM">Communications of the ACM retrospective article</a> (and
  open-access, slightly extended <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2430732">ACM Queue version</a>)
  cover this evolution in significant detail.
</p>

<h2 id="industry">Industry</h2>

<p>Technology transition plays a central role in my research, and I take a
particular interest in transition of research through open source systems.
I have worked closely with a number of companies, including Apple and Juniper
Networks  as they have adopted open source systems to both help them engage with
the open source community, improved open source software to better meet their
needs, and helped them upstream improvements to the open source community.
Recent projects have included open source adaptations of Apple's Grand Central
Dispatch, collaborative development of the OpenBSM operating system audit
framework between Apple and the FreeBSD Project, and work on highly scalable
multi-core TCP processing with Juniper.
Slightly longer ago, I worked with several companies including Apple and nCircle
to help them use and extend the TrustedBSD MAC Framework, a kernel reference
monitor now used as the foundation for access control in Mac OS X, iOS, Junos,
McAfee's Sidewinder firewall, nCircle's IP360 appliance, and many other products.
</p>

<p>Prior to coming to Cambridge, I worked for a series of industrial research labs
in the US, including SPARTA ISSO, Trusted Information Systems - Advanced Research
and Engineering, and McAfee Research.
While there I led a number of network and 
operating system security research projects for government and industrial
sponsors, including DARPA, the US Navy, Apple Computer, and others.
</p>

<p>I offer consulting services to companies in the areas of open source integration
for products, network stack performance, and operating system audit and access
control.
A list of past customers and projects is available on request; please
contact me directly with any queries.

<p>In addition to my academic work, I'm on the board of directors of the
<a href="http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a>, a US-based
non-profit foundation supporting the open source
<a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD Project</a>.
I'm an active contributor to the project, working in the areas of
multiprocessor-centric network stacks, operating system security audit,
and mandatory access control.
I was a member of the FreeBSD Project's elected Core Team for 12 years, and
continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of the non-profit
FreeBSD Foundation supporting the project.
I'm also involved in the project's security officer and release engineering
