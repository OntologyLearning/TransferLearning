<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/opera/publications/index.html"> Opera publications </A>.

<P><B>Other interests</B> include wildlife (especially botany), walking and painting.<BR> 
I had an exhibition in Blythburgh Church, Suffolk, August 2007, see 
<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~km10/JMB-Exhibition-2007/">reedbed paintings.</A> These resulted from a year's photographs taken by Ken Moody, which can be seen from the website. The exhibition, extended with new paintings and photographs, was repeated in King's College Art Centre, February 2008, 
see <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~km10/JMB-Exhibition-2008/">Exhibition 2008.</A> 
The <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~km10/JMB-Exhibition-2005/">February 2005,</A> exhibition in King's showed flower paintings, abstracts and some paintings done in St Saturnin, Provence.<BR> 
Earlier exhibitions had web images of low resolution and poor colour quality, created from scanned-in photographic prints: 
 <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jmb/pics97.html">January 1997</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jmb/pics98.html">February 1998</A> and July 2000, in King's College Art Centre.<BR><BR>  

In 2010 I did a <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~km10/JMB-Panels-2010/"> six-piece acrylic</A>, with colours inspired by two small watercolours by Paul Klee. This was a challenge for the photographer. <BR><BR>

Current projects are winter trees in low sunlight and the explosion of may blossom and cow parsley in spring.</P>
