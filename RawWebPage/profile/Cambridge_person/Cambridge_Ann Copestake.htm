<H2>Contacting me</H2>

Email is best: I hope everyone can work out my email from the information
above.  I don't have `office hours': students should
email me to arrange a time to meet.  Prospective students, interns 
and so on contacting me for the first time, 
please read this 
<A HREF="email-response.html">page about emailing me</A> first.

<H2>Research overview</H2>

My research is in Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Computational
Linguistics, mostly in formal representation issues, 
compositional and lexical semantics
and natural language generation.
I am also the original 
developer of the <A HREF="http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LkbTop">LKB system</A>
which is a freely available grammar and lexicon development environment
for constraint-based frameworks including HPSG.
I've worked on a variety of application areas including scientific 
text processing,
information extraction, augmentative
and alternative communication (AAC), machine translation,  
Natural Language Interfaces, lexical acquisition
and on tools for lexicographers.
I am generally interested in applications involving
broad coverage text processing.

Some details on ongoing work are available from the 
<A HREF="projects.html">project web pages</A>.
See also <A HREF="research.html">current research directions</A>.
<p>

<H3>Projects</H3>

See the <A HREF="projects.html">list of projects</A>
for details of funded projects for which I have been PI at Cambridge.
The larger projects have their own web pages.


I have a long-term involvement 
in <A HREF="http://www.delph-in.net/">DELPH-IN</A>.
This is not a conventional 
funded project but
a loosely structured consortium of researchers developing open source grammars
and technology for linguistically-motivated NLP.  Essentially a
generalised or internationalised version of
<A HREF="http://lingo.stanford.edu/">LinGO</A> Linguistic Grammars Online.
My main involvement is with the development of semantic representations
(MRS/RMRS/DMRS) and in the LKB grammar development environment. 
We use DELPH-IN technology in all the funded projects.

<p>I am also currently (since March 2013) 
involved in the <a href="http://www.cost.eu">COST</a> (European Cooperation in Science and
Technology framework) Action Project IC1207:
`<a href="http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/ict/Actions/IC1207">PARSEME:
 PARSing and Multi-word Expressions. Towards linguistic precision and 
computational efficiency in natural language processing</a>'.

<H2>Short Biography</H2>

After getting a degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
(mostly Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry),
I worked for Unilever Research for two years, and 
then did the Diploma in Computer Science at Cambridge. I started 
doing research in
Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistics 
at the 
University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory
in 1985.  I worked for ten years on a
series of projects, including 
<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/acquilex/">
ACQUILEX</A>.  During that time 
I also did a PhD in 
<A HREF="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/">
Computer Science at the University of Sussex
</A> (1990-1992), 
was a visitor at 
Xerox PARC (1993/4) and 
worked on the Verbmobil project
for the University of Stuttgart (1994/5).  From July 1994 to October 2000 
I was at 
<A HREF="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/">CSLI</A>, Stanford University,
as a Senior Researcher.
I became a University Lecturer at Cambridge in October 2000
and am now a Professor.
