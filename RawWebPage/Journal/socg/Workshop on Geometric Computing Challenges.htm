<p>Geometric computing challenges exist since geometric algorithms and data structures get discussed. The very first implementations were far from being reliable; state-of-the-art solutions (e.g. CGAL) result from a journey of more than twenty years. This minisymposium starts with picking up from the past to discuss challenges achieved - best in a reliable and efficient way. The next part is about how to attack challenges in implementing algorithms and data structures. The last part focuses on the future: What are the current open challenges and their main problems? There will also be room for discussion and collecting ideas to address the needs of beginners. This minisymposium can be seen as the add-on platform to discuss implementation aspects more in-depth as possible during the SoCG presentations. It could serve as a motivation for more contributions to software projects.</p>
<p>The topic is interpreted quite broadly, providing a platform for implementation- and software-related issues which are typically cut short in the technical program of SoCG. Talks will cover answers to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which approaches and techniques have led to successful implementations in the past?</li>
<li>What are the areas in which advances in geometric algorithms are most urgently needed?</li>
<li>How can existing software be simplified or otherwise brought to a broader audience?</li>
<li>Does the community require more implementation work, and how can researchers be motivated to spent more time on it?</li>
</ul>

<div><a href="http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il/danhalperin" target="_blank">Dan Halperin</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: Arrangements of curves and surfaces are ubiquitous structures in computational geometry, which have numerous applications. A central question that arises in practice is what is an effective representation of arrangements. The representation of choice may in turn determine how the arrangements are computed. I will survey various approaches to computing and representing arrangements, pointing to the advantages and shortcomings of each approach. In addition to the prevalent approaches, which include exact geometric computing, geometric rounding, and perturbation, I will also outline more recent approaches, and in particular our attempt at a hybrid (exact cum sampling-based) representation of arrangements in high-dimensional configuration spaces.</div>

<div><a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Olivier.Devillers/" target="_blank">Olivier Devillers</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: The Delaunay triangulation is one of the most famous structures in computational geometry, and its construction has been studied in numerous papers. In this paper, we are interested in the practical efficiency of the removal procedure in a two-dimensional triangulation.<br /><br />Several algorithms exist for this problem whose complexities are usually given in terms of the degree d of the removed vertex. Few algorithms have linear O(d) complexity, let us mention the algorithm by Aggarwal, Guibas, Saxe, and Shor which provides a quite complicated determinis- tic solution and the simpler solution by Chew whose complexity is randomized and is still a bit overkill for small degrees. An O(d log d) complexity is achieved by Devillers using a predicate of degree higher than that of the usual incircle test, another O(d log d) solution computes the triangulation of the neighbors of the removed points and glues the relevant part of this small triangulation in the hole arising from the removal. In practice, O(d2) solutions are often preferred for their simplicity, the two most common are the boundary completion and the diagonal flipping. <br /><br />Deletion in Delaunay triangulation seems to be a solved problem, but the devil is in the details of the implementation. We show that a careful implementation of low degree cases allows to drastically reduce the deletion time for these degrees, improving the global performance by almost a factor of 2. By the way, a modification of the diagonal flipping algorithm, in the same spirit, improves its efficiency by 20%.<br /><br />After a brief review of general purpose deletion algorithms, the specialized versions for low degrees are detailed from the algorithmic and implementation points of view. Experiments are given to support design choices. The implementation was done using CGAL, and is integrated in CGAL since release 3.7.</div>

<div><a href="http://www.i1.informatik.uni-bonn.de/de/content/dr-elmar-langetepe" target="_blank">Elmar Langetepe</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: In this talk we will show that flexible implementations and animations for geometric problems can be used for supporting theoretical work in CG. On the one hand flexible implementations can invoke interesting theoretical questions. On the other hand without electronical assistance the construction of counterexamples could be a very tedious task. Furthermore, constructing arbitrary examples for given algorithms gives immediate insight into the nature of the problem. This is very helpful for teaching. We show significant examples regarding Voronoi diagrams and motion planning. The corresponding implementations were developed at our department, see also <a href="http://www.geometrylab.de/">www.geometrylab.de</a>. </div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-danny"></a>Geometric Algorithms and Implementation for Medical Applications</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~dchen/" target="_blank">Danny Z. Chen</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: Computer technology plays a vital role in modern medicine and life sciences, especially in diagnostic imaging, human genome study, medical surgery and therapy, and medical data management. As computing technology continues to evolve, computer science research and development will inevitably become an integral part of modern medicine. Since computational problems in modern medicine have direct impacts on the quality of life, the need of high quality algorithmic solutions for such problems is very pressing. <br /><br />In this talk, we present a set of important geometric problems and solutions in medical research and applications. We highlight several key computational problems in radiation cancer treatment and medical imaging, show how to formulate them as algorithmic problems, and provide efficient algorithms for solving these problems based on techniques of computational geometry and graph theory. We also discuss some algorithmic problems that arise in emerging medical research and clinical practice, such as cell identification and cell distribution analysis (in diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer and auto-immune diseases). We also consider implementation issues and give experimental data and results to illustrate the clinical applications of several of our algorithms. </div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-tamal"></a>Better Handles and Tunnels with Geometry and Software Considerations</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~tamaldey/" target="_blank">Tamal K. Dey</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: Many applications seek to identify features like `handles' and `tunnels' in a 3D model. To this end we define handle and tunnel loops on surfaces which can help identifying these features. A closed surface of genus $g$ always has $g$ handle and $g$ tunnel loops determined by its embedding into 3D. Computing such loops while optimizing their geometric lengths is difficult. In this talk, first we describe an algorithm that computes a set of handle and tunnel loops. These loops, though topologically correct, may not be useful since they are mostly geometry-oblivious. We show how these loops can be tightened by considering geometry. The algorithm is based on the concept of topological persistence. It requires a tessellation of the 3D space bounded by the given input surface which could be computationally costly. Fruthermore, 3D tessellations may alter the input surface mesh. In a recent development, we have discovered another algorithm that does not require such 3D tessellations thus saving computational cost and avoiding input alterations. The usability of the computed loops is demonstrated with some examples in feature detection and topology simplification. </div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-kevin"></a>Algorithms for Movement Ecology</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~kbuchin/" target="_blank">Kevin A. Buchin</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: Movement ecology aims to understand causes, mechanisms, patterns, and consequences of movement, in particular of animals. For this, it studies movement paths sampled over time. In this talk, I present our current work on algorithmic tools for the analysis of these data. To obtain a continuous path from discrete samples, we model movement as a stochastic process, specifically as Brownian bridges. That is, the movement between samples is assumed to follow a random path. I show how to extract movement parameters and detect movement patterns in this model. Next I describe possible ways to integrate environmental factors and behavioral states into the analysis. Finally, I present ways to segment the movement path based on Brownian bridges and on behavioral states. We provide these tools in R, an environment for statistical computing and modeling commonly used in movement ecology. </div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-stefanh"></a>Implementing Geometric Algorithms for Real-World Applications - With and Without EGC-Support</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.sthu.org/" target="_blank">Stefan Huber</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: In this talk we discuss implementations of geometric algorithms based on either standard floating-point arithmetic or EGC libraries: FIST for triangulating polygonal areas, VRONI/ArcVRONI for computing Voronoi diagrams of straight-line segments and circular arcs, and STALGO for computing straight skeletons of planar-straight line graphs. (All three codes have been implemented, are actively maintained by the authors and are widely used in industry.) <br /><br />We start with reviewing common design principles and measures taken in our codes in order to make them robust enough to handle real-world data in industrial applications. In the second part of the talk we compare our floating-point based codes to EGC-based counterparts and investigate how our codes can benefit from EGC libraries or arbitrary-precision libraries. In particular, we discuss the changes necessary to get our codes to work with CORE and MPFR as alternative arithmetic backends. We report on insights gained during this work and present experimental results in which we compare the reliability, correctness, computational performance and numerical accuracy of our codes with and without alternative arithmetic backend. We conclude our talk with a discussion of open problems that occur when applying EGC libraries in real-world applications and suggest directions for possible future improvements. <br /><br />The talk is based on joint work by Martin Held, Stefan Huber and Willi Mann. </div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-michael"></a>Non-linear Geometry in CGAL -- Overview, Integration History and Future Challenges</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/hemmer/" target="_blank">Michael Hemmer</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library, was started in 1995 with the ultimate goal to make the large body of geometric algorithms, developed within the field of computational geometry, available for industrial application. While in the beginning the focus was clearly on exact and fast support of linear geometry, during the last decade the library has incorporated algorithms and data structures for non linear objects. This presentation will give a survey of the non-linear geometry that is currently supported by CGAL and attempts to give an overview of the integration history. In particular it will give background about the interplay of the different layers and related past and future challenges.</div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-chee"></a>Beyond Exact Geometric Computation</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/yap/" target="_blank">Chee K. Yap</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: Exact Geometric Computation (EGC) has provided a powerful paradigm for correct implementation of geometric algorithms for two decades. It is the most successful technique in Computational Geometry, and has led to successful libraries and practical robust algorithms for many basic problems. We now have a fairly good understanding of the key techniques and what can be achieved under this paradigm. We review some strong reasons to extend this paradigm:
<ul>
<li>The existence of EGC solutions may not be known (e.g., analytic roots)</li>
<li>EGC is too inefficient (e.g., shortest path amidst discs)</li>
<li>EGC entails numerous and difficult algebraic analysis (e.g., Vor diagram of polyhedra)</li>
<li>Exactness is inappropriate (e.g., motion planning)</li>
<li>Degeneracy requires zero bounds</li>
</ul>
In each case, the intuitive idea of introducing an epsilon-parameter suggests itself. But how to use this parameter is not always clear; one thing is clear -- we must not abuse the epsilon by treating it as an exact algebraic quantity. Ultimately, our goal is to develop purely numerical approaches for solving these problems. The introduction of numerical techniques in Computational Geometry will allow us to solve new problems which were previously untouchable because of our exactness outlook. We will illustrate with several examples.</div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-pankaj"></a>Range Searching and its Relatives: Theory &amp; Practice</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~pankaj/" target="_blank">Pankaj K. Agarwal</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: Range searching is a classical problem that has been studied extensively both in computational geometry and databases. Over the last three decades, several sophisticated geometric techniques and data structures (e.g. kd-trees, range trees, eps-nets, cuttings, simplicial partitions) have been proposed for range seraching that have had a profound impact on the field, much beyond range searching. Despite this tremendous progress on range searching, there is a big gap between theoretical results and the approaches used in practice for this problem, partly because the theoretically best known results are not easy to implement and partly because the goals have shifted. This talk reviews new variants of range searching that have emerged in the last few years and discusses some of the approaches that are being used in practice.</div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-suresh"></a>Geometric Computing in the Classroom</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/web/" target="_blank">Suresh Venkatasubramanian</a> in collaboration with <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/" target="_blank">Philip Guo</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract:  The early days of the Web were a goldmine for geometric algorithm demos. The visual and interactive nature of geometric algorithms, coupled with the proliferation of lightweight Java applets, made the HTML canvas a fantastic portable framework for teaching and demonstrations. <br /><br />Fast forward to 2013. We have a blizzard of Javascript frameworks, sophisticated HTML5 based in-browser animations, and a host of new platforms on which to demo algorithms. We also have a mature geometric computing platform in the form of CGAL. But we no longer have geometric demos that work well (or at all in many cases). <br /><br />The Online Python Tutor (http://pythontutor.com/) has shown how a modern Web-based interactive interface can be a powerful aid to visualizing and interacting with simple algorithms. We suggest ways of linking CGAL and Online Python Tutor to make demoing and teaching geometric algorithms fun and easy for instructors and students.</div>

<div><strong><a name="abstract-jonathan"></a>Dynamic Meshing for Finite Element Simulations with Radically Changing Geometry</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/" target="_blank">Jonathan Shewshuk</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: I describe software for physically simulating materials that are substantially reshaped by fluid flow, plastic flow, fracture, and material merging. We combine standard Lagrangian finite element methods with algorithms for dynamic remeshing, which update a volume mesh undergoing radical deformations so that its tetrahedra do not deteriorate below a fixed quality threshold. Our dynamic mesher is conservative: it replaces as few tetrahedra as possible, and thereby limits the visual artifacts and artificial diffusion that would be introduced if we repeatedly remeshed the domain from scratch. It also locally refines and coarsens a mesh, and even creates anisotropic tetrahedra, wherever a simulation requests it. Our simulation method addresses a range of material behavior from purely elastic to highly plastic and from inviscid to viscous fluids, with particular advantages for materials in which these properties are mixed such as melting metals. I illustrate these capabilities with animations of fluid flow and deforming elastoplastic objects. <br /><br />The evolution of the material surfaces are controlled by a complicated mix of the physical simulation and the mesh geometry. I discuss the challenges posed by the need to maintain a high-quality mesh and perform topological changes in the material without compromising the accuracy of the simulation. </div>

<div><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~naeher/" target="_blank">Stefan Näher</a></div>
<div><br />Abstract: In this talk we want to discuss some aspects and experiences with exact geometric computing and report about recent activities in developing and implementing parallel geometric algorithms for multi-core computers. As an application example we will use a project for reconstructing the underlying road map of a large gps data set of bicycle tracks.</div>
