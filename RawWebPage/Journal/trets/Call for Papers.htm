Call for Papers
</span>
</p>

The editors of the ACM
<em>Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems</em>,
a peer-reviewed and archival journal that covers reconfigurable technology,
systems and applications on reconfigurable computers, invite the submission of
original, full length papers according to the guidelines under the
<a href="./tretsauthors.html">Information for Authors</a> on this website.

<p>
TRETS is a new journal focused on research in, on, and with reconfigurable
systems and on their underlying technology.
The scope, rationale, and coverage by other journals are often limited to
particular aspects of reconfigurable technology or reconfigurable systems.
TRETS will be a journal that covers reconfigurability in its own right.
</p>

<p>
Topics that would be appropriate for TRETS would include all levels of
reconfigurable system abstractions and all aspects of reconfigurable
technology including platforms, programming environments and application
successes that support these systems for computing or other applications.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
The board and systems architectures of a reconfigurable platform.
</li>

<li>
Programming environments of reconfigurable systems, especially those designed
for use with reconfigurable systems that will lead to increased programmer
productivity.
</li>

<li>
Languages and compilers for reconfigurable systems.
</li>

<li>
Logic synthesis and related tools, as they relate to reconfigurable systems.
</li>

<li>
Applications on which success can be demonstrated.
</li>

<li>
The underlying technology from which reconfigurable systems are developed.
(Currently this technology is that of FPGAs, but research on the nature
and use of follow-on technologies is appropriate for TRETS.)
</li>
</ul>

In considering whether a paper is suitable for TRETS, the foremost question
should be whether reconfigurability has been essential to success.
Topics such as architecture, programming languages, compilers, and environments,
logic synthesis, and high performance applications are all suitable if the context
is appropriate.
For example, an architecture for an embedded application that happens to use
FPGAs is not necessarily suitable for TRETS, but an architecture using FPGAs
for which the reconfigurability of the FPGAs is an inherent part of the
specifications (perhaps due to a need for re-use on multiple applications)
<em>would</em> be appropriate for TRETS.
