Information for Authors
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="titlestyle">
Editorial Process
</span>
</p>
TRETS will accept submissions which have not been published or
submitted in any form elsewhere.
The Editors-in-Chief or Associate Editors will solicit reviews and
make a publication recommendation; the Editors-in-Chief will make
the final decision.
Three anonymous reviews will be the norm, and every effort will be
made to ensure a swift review process consistent with the fair and
professional reviews that authors have a right to expect.
</p>

<p>
TRETS will publish outstanding papers which are "major value-added
extensions" of papers previously published in conferences; that is,
TRETS will not automatically reject papers that are major extensions
to previously published conference papers.
These papers will go through the normal review process.
The common practice of "at least 30% new material beyond the
conference publication" will be applied by TRETS, and authors should
explicitly identify the new material either in the paper or in
the cover letter.
</p>

<p>
TRETS will occasionally publish special issues to provide a timely
boost to promising areas of research and development, or a timely
consolidation of the results in other areas.
Guest editors will be invited to organize such issues.
</p>

<p>
Submitted papers are evaluated by anonymous referees for originality,
relevance, and presentation.
(Please see the TRETS Referee Guidelines for more details.)
The author will be notified of the name of an Associate Editor
who will be responsible for the processing of the manuscript, and
should address correspondence to that Associate Editor.
</p>

<p>
<!--
TRETS discourages excessively long papers (longer than 40 double-spaced
pages including figures, references, etc.), and unnecessary
digressions even in shorter papers.
-->
TRETS encourages high-quality submissions that are concise, with no
more than 22 published pages including figures, tables, and references.

Authors should expect that in longer papers any lengthy appendices,
program listings, or similar matter will be published online by ACM
and not appear as part of the printed paper.
</p>

<p>
TRETS normally will not publish survey papers.
Authors who wish a survey paper to be considered for TRETS should
submit directly to the Editors-in-Chief to determine if a full
review is appropriate.
</p>

<p>

Options for authors to manage rights and permissions for their work
</span>
</p>

<p>
ACM has introduced a publishing license agreement, an updated copyright transfer agreement, and a
new author-pays option which allows for perpetual open access through the ACM Digital Library. For more information,
visit the ACM Author Rights webpage at <a href="authors.acm.org">authors.acm.org</a>.</p>
</p>

<p>
<span class="titlestyle">
Manuscript Format, Preparation, and Submission
</span>
</p>

<p>
Authors are encouraged to consult the
<a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs">ACM Publications</a>
web page, and especially the directions regarding
<a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/submissions/submission.htm">Electronically submitting accepted articles to ACM journals</a>;
following those directions and guidelines will speed the process of having
your papers reviewed and published.
All manuscripts for TRETS must be submitted electronically as
Microsoft Word or as pdf files to 
<a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/trets">ACM Manuscript Central</a>.
Once you are at that site, you will be asked to create an account and password
with which you can enter the manuscript review tracking system.
This account is different from the ACM account that you may have.
From a drop-down list of journals, choose Transactions on Reconfigurable
Technology and Systems and proceed to the Author Center to submit your
manuscript and any other accompanying files.

Published papers will be required to be submitted in ACM format.
This format is encouraged but not required for initial submission.
</p>

<p>
Authors must include as part of the manuscript a descriptive title, author names
and affiliations, an abstract of 150-200 words, and indexing information consistent
with the Computing Reviews Classification Scheme (most recently released in 1998).
Please select at least one primary-level classification followed by two
secondary-level classications.
Proper classification by the authors, who best know their work, will aid in the
review and publication process.  
</p>

<p>
Questions about submissions should be directed to one of the Editors-in-Chief
or by email to <em>trets</em> in the domain <em>acm.org</em>.
</p>

<p>
Technical content is the primary criterion for acceptability, but the presentation
of the technical content is also critical for a successful paper.
Authors are encouraged to take this into account before submitting papers, because
extremely poor presentation can contribute to a poor evaluation by a reviewer.
</p>

<p>
Note that graphics can be prepared in colour or black and white.  If graphics are in colour, they
will appear in colour in the version hosted in the ACM Digital Library, but printed in black and white
in the paper version of the journal.
</p>

<p>
In papers describing experimental results, authors should strive to report
experiments with replicability as a goal.
Such papers shall report results on standard test sets using standard metrics.
Authors shall cite the best known results on these test sets.
Authors shall provide statistical significance tests on their results.
There is little value in a paper that describes an experiment using authors'
private data, private test sets, and authors' own metric.
In case there are no standard tests or metrics in the paper's area, the authors shall
have a mechanism to provide the test material and the evaluation tool to the community.
</p>

<p>
<em>NOTE:</em>
The ACM Digital Library will host ancillary material for a paper
on its web site.
This material, an online appendix that does not appear in the print
journal, is linked to and accessed from the online table of contents.
For example, authors could provide hypertext and/or XML versions of
their papers, or animations, or any other appropriate technology.
Authors that wish to use this option should attach such material as
an appendix to their submission and indicate in their cover letter
that this material is intended to be ancillary material included
in the digital library, and how it is intended to be accessed.
All ancillary material should be free from viruses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="titlestyle">
Prior Publication Policy
</span>
</p>

<p>
The technical contributions appearing in ACM journals are normally original
papers which have not been published elsewhere.
Widely disseminated conference proceedings and newsletters are a form of publication.
</p>

<p>
The submitted manuscript should have at least 30% new material.
The new material should be content material, not just the addition
of obvious proofs or a few more straightforward performance figures.
The submitted manuscript affords an opportunity to describe the novel
approach in more depth, to consider the alternatives more comprehensively,
and to delve into some of the issues listed in the other paper as future work.
At the same time, it is not required that the submitted manuscript contain
all of the material from the published paper.
To the contrary: only enough material need be included from the published
paper to set the context and render the new material comprehensible.
</p>

<p>
TRETS expects that papers submitted to it will not have been simultaneously
submitted elsewhere.
The corresponding author of a TRETS submission must inform the editor handling
that submission about any paper by any author of the TRETS submission that
(a) is in submission,
(b) has been accepted for publication, or
(c) has been published, that overlaps significantly (more than a page or so)
with the TRETS submission.
Such papers in categories (b) and (c) should be referenced by the TRETS submission
and discussed in the related work section, as appropriate.
The corresponding author should also inform the editor about any overlaps that
occur while the paper is under consideration by TRETS.
In all cases, the Editors-in-Chief will make the determination as to whether
the overlap is acceptable and reserve the right to reject papers if these guidelines
have not been followed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="titlestyle">
ACM Plagiarism Policy
</span>
</p>

<p>
ACM has established a rigorous policy on plagiarism.
Manuscripts found in violation of this policy will be immediately rejected.
Authors of papers found to be in violation after publication face severe penalties.
It is important that all authors and co-authors review this policy before submission.
Note that this policy also covers the practice of self-plagiarism
(i.e., reuse of one's own previously published material without reference to
the original source).
</p>

<p>
For more information, see the
<a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/plagiarism%20policy.html">ACM Policy on Plagiarism</a>.

ACM Author-Izer Service
</span>
</p>

<p>
ACM Author-Izer is a unique service that enables ACM authors to generate and post links on either their home page or institutional repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their articles from the ACM Digital Library at no charge.

Downloads from these sites are captured in official ACM statistics, improving the accuracy of usage and impact measurements.  Consistently linking to definitive version of ACM articles should reduce user confusion over article versioning.

ACM Author-Izer also extends ACM's reputation as an innovative "Green Path" publisher, making ACM one of the first publishers of scholarly works to offer this model to its authors.

To access ACM Author-Izer, authors need to establish a free ACM web account.  Should authors change institutions or sites, they can utilize the new ACM service to disable old links and re-authorize new links for free downloads from a different site.
