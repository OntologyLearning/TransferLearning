<h1>When Does a Conflict of Interest Exist?</h1>
<br/>
  <p>If you have a conflict of interest with a submission, you should not be
      involved in the decision process for that submission in any capacity, as
      Reviewer, Associate Editor, or Editor-in-Chief. </p>
      <p>If you are asked to participate in the reviewing of a submission and
      have a conflict of interest, please let the requester know and decline to
      participate. Most conflicts of interest can be recognized with common
      sense: Would an outsider who knew that you were involved in the reviewing
      process reasonably be concerned that you might be biased either for or
      against the submission because of your relationship to the authors or
      their research?</p>
      <br/>
      <p>There is usually a conflict of interest if the submission concerns work
      ...</p>
      <br/>
<ul>
      <li> ... from an institution at which you have recently worked</li>
      <li> ... by a recent coauthor</li>
      <li> ... by a family member</li>
      <li> ... by an advisor or advisee of yours</li>
      <li> ... in which you have a non-trivial financial stake</li>
      </ul>
<br/>
      <p>&ldquo;Recent&rdquo; can be read as &ldquo;within the last 5 years&rdquo;. Membership in an
      author&rsquo;s Ph.D. committee should be viewed as similar to coauthorship, and
      the criterion of &ldquo;recency&rdquo; applies. But note that there is no time limit
      associated with the advisor/advisee relationship.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Other circumstances may create a potential conflict, requiring careful
      thought on a case-to-case basis.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>If you are in doubt, please describe the potential conflict to the
      Associate Editor who requested your participation &ndash; or, if you are an
      Associate Editor, to the Editors-in-Chief &ndash; and ask for guidance.<a name="ae-policy" class="target">&nbsp;</a>
      <br/>
      <br/>
<h1>Conflict-of-Interest Policy for Associate Editors</h1></p>
<br/>
  <p>Associate Editors may publish papers in TiiS. The Editors-in-Chief
        will choose an Associate Editor with no conflict of interest to handle
        the paper. As usual, this Associate Editor will not be identified to the
        authors of the submission.<a name="eic-policy" class="target">&nbsp;</a>
        <br/>
        <br/>
<h1>Conflict-of-Interest Policy for Editors-in-Chief</h1></p>
<br/>
  <p>If one of the Editors-in-Chief (EiCs) has a conflict of interest with
        a submission but is not an author of that submission, the other EiC will
        assign an Associate Editor to handle the submission. This other EiC will
        make the final decision. If both EiCs have a conflict of interest with a
        submission, the same procedure will be applied as for a submission by an
        EiC (see the following section).<a name="eic-submission-policy" class="target">&nbsp;</a>
        <br/>
        <br/>
<h1>Conflict-of-Interest Policy for a Submission by an
    Editor-in-Chief</h1></p>
    <br/>
  <p>(Note: ACM requires that a policy for this situation exist and be
      published on the journal&rsquo;s website.)</p>
      <p>The purpose of this policy is to address the conflict of interest that
      arises when an Editor-in-Chief (EiC) of an ACM journal is an author of a
      paper submitted to that journal.</p>
      <br/>
<h2> Reasons for Allowing Submissions by an Editor-in-Chief</h2>       
<br/>
      <p>ACM does permit an EiC to be an author of a paper in the EiC&rsquo;s journal.
      Outright prohibition of EiC authorship is considered too severe for at
      least three reasons: First, it can unduly penalize the EiC&rsquo;s coauthors. In
      several computing disciplines, the ACM Transactions is the premier &ndash; and
      sometimes the only &ndash; high-quality, archival venue for research
      publication. A strict prohibition would impact the EiC&rsquo;s coauthors,
      especially if they were just starting their research careers. Second, a
      general prohibition could prevent some high-quality papers from appearing
      in ACM journals. ACM&rsquo;s stated mission is to be the publisher of choice.
      Good work should be evaluated on its merits and not on the basis of
      authorship. Third, a prohibition could be a disincentive for leading
      researchers to serve as EiC, especially insofar as this prohibition would
      affect coauthors, in particular graduate students.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Many ACM conferences do not permit a program chair to submit papers. The
      three arguments given above apply with some force to ACM conferences as
      well; but because of the multiyear terms of EiCs, there is a more
      compelling case for journals than for conferences.</p>
      <br/>
<h2> Details of the Policy</h2>   
<br/>    
      <p>The procedure for processing a submission to TiiS with an EiC as an
      author is as follows:</p>
      <br/>
<ul>
        <li> The EiC will submit the paper to an Associate Editor who has been
        specifically designated for this purpose and explicitly identified in
        the TiiS website. The designated Associate
        Editor must have agreed to accept this responsibility and should not be
        a collaborator of an EiC or from the same organization as an EiC.</li>
        <br/>
        <li> The Associate Editor designated in Step 1 (called &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; for
        concreteness) will not process the paper herself, but will hand it to
        another Associate Editor (&ldquo;Bob&rdquo;) whose identity will not be disclosed to
        the EiCs.   </li>
        <br/>
        <li> Bob will execute the normal function of an Associate Editor for the
        paper (see the description of the reviewing procedure), except that that
        he will also make the final decision, without consulting the EiCs. Bob
        will report the final decision to Alice, who will in turn convey it to
        the EiCs.</li>
</ul>

<br/>
      <p>As an exception, if the EiC&rsquo;s paper is submitted for consideration for a
      special issue that is being managed by a Guest Editor, the Associate
      Editors will not be involved in the way described above. Instead, the
      Guest Editor will make the final decision. The identities of the reviewers
      of the EiC&rsquo;s submission will not be disclosed to the EiC.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>In order to avoid the possible impression of biased processing, the
      (implicit or explicit) standards of acceptability must be applied
      especially rigorously and conservatively to any paper (co)authored by an
      EiC; if such a submission is marginal in any way, it should be rejected.
