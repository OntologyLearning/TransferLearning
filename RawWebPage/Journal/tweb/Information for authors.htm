      <h1>Information for authors</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Is TWEB the right place to publish your work?</strong><br />
        <br />
        ACM TWEB welcomes original, unpublished research papers which 
        are not under consideration for publication elsewhere. The topic of the paper should fall 
        within the scope of TWEB's charter and topic areas described in the <a href="http://www.acm.org/tweb/cfp.html">Call 
        for Papers</a>. </p>
       </p>
      <p>Publication of an enhanced version of a previously published conference 
        paper is possible if the review process determines that (a) the revision 
        contains significant enhancements, amplification or clarification of the 
        original material and (b) there is a significant additional benefit to 
        be gained from journal publication. Any prior appearance of a substantial 
        amount of a submission should be noted in the submission letter and on the title 
        page; a footnote on the first page should indicate that the paper is an extended 
        version of the earlier paper (s). A separate file should describe the differences between the original 
        conference paper and the new submission; this file should be uploaded according to the
        directions in the Manuscript Central paper submission system. The authors should also upload an electronic
        version of the earlier publcation (s) according to the directions in Manuscript Central.
     
           
Authors are encouraged to read the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions">ACM 
        Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions</a> as well as the 
<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism
(including self plagiarism)</a>.
TWEB forbids authors from submitting papers which 
would be under consideration simultaneously for publication in both TWEB and another copyrighted forum.</p>
 <!--      <p>TWEB publishes original research papers. Survey papers will be considered 
        only if they present a new perspective or clearly benefit the field. TWEB 
        will also consider ideas for special issues. </p> --> 
      <p>Submissions should be well-positioned within the WWW literature, showing 
        how the work reported fits in with existing work. References to relevant 
        papers in the WWW literature should be cited - if there are few of these 
        then the paper may not be relevant for TWEB (see <a href="author.html#related">Related 
        work below</a>).  Papers should also have a substantial evaluation section.</p>
      <p><strong>Formatting and preparing your manuscript</strong><br />
        <br />
        TWEB requires that articles be submitted electronically. Articles must follow 
        the "Small Standard Format" described in the 
        <a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/submissions/submission.htm">ACM formatting 
        guidelines</a>. Submissions that do not conform to these guidelines will be 
        returned to the authors for correction.</p>
      <p>To ensure proper indexing, classification, retrieval and dissemination, 
        authors must include the following in the manuscript.</p>
      <p> Descriptive title<br />
        Author names and affiliations<br />
        Abstract<br />
        Content indicators<br />
        Related work <br />
        Citations to relevant literature </p>
      <p>The following are guidelines for the preparation of this material.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Descriptive title</li>
        <li>Author names and affiliations<br />
          Authors' names should be given without titles or degrees along with 
          the names and addresses of the authors' institution.  Identify the contact author for co-authored work.</li>
        <li>Abstract<br />
          The abstract should concisely state 
          the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle 
          conclusions, but omit future plans and citations. </li>
        <li>Content indicators (required once paper is accepted)<br />
          Three types of content indicators must be assigned: (1) categories and 
          subject descriptors, (2) general terms, (3) keywords and phrases. The 
          first two items are selected from the Computing Reviews Classification 
          Scheme most recently revised in 1998. Select as many as are applicable. 
          The keywords and phrases are additional English language words that 
          indicate the content of the submission.</li>
        <li><a name="related" id="related"></a>Related work<br />
          Submissions should cite relevant WWW work, showing how this work is 
          related to prior research. Relevant research can occur in many sources, 
          such as <a href="http://www.sigweb.org/conferences/www-cover.shtml">WWW 
          conferences</a> and other <a href="http://www.sigweb.org/conferences/">SIGWEB 
          conferences</a>, other ACM journals such as <a href="http://www.acm.org/toit/">TOIT</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/tois/">TOIS</a> and many others. </li>
        <li>Citations to relevant literature<br />
          Citations should be referenced within the text of the paper.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It may be helpful useful to look at the <a href="reviewform2.doc">review form</a> 
        that reviewers will complete in reviewing your paper, as it can assist 
        you in preparing your paper.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The ACM Digital Library will host ancillary material for a paper 
        on its web site. This material, an online appendix that does not appear 
        in the print journal, is linked to and accessed from the online table 
        of contents. For example, authors could provide hypertext and/or XML versions 
        of their papers, or animations, or any other appropriate technology. Authors 
        that wish to use this option should attach such material as an appendix 
        to their submission and indicate in their cover letter that this material 
        is intended to be ancillary material included in the digital library, 
        and how it is intended to be accessed. All ancillary material should be 
        free from viruses.</p>
      <p><strong>Submitting your manuscript</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p>Before submitting a manuscript, please use a spelling checker and correct 
        errors in punctuation, grammar, figure and table numbering, and so forth. 
      </p>
      <p>Authors are asked to submit manuscripts in PDF format.</p>
      <p>You are welcome to indicate what general area within the TWEB scope you 
        feel is most appropriate for your manuscript.</p>
      <p>To submit your papers, please submit them via <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/acm/tweb"> Manuscript Central, http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/acm/tweb </a>

<!-- please email your PDF to <a href="mailto:tweb%20%3Cat%3E%20acm%20%3Cdot%3E%20org">tweb 
        &lt;at&gt; acm &lt;dot&gt; org </a>
-->
 </p>
      <p><strong>The Review process</strong><br />
        <br />
        When we receive your manuscript and verify that it can be read and is 
        within the scope of the journal, an Associate Editor will take responsibility 
        for handling the review process. The Associate Editor will assign the 
        article to 3-4 reviewers, study the reviews that are returned, and make 
        an overall recommendation to the Editors-in-Chief.</p>
      <p>After you submit your paper via <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/acm/tweb"> Manuscript Central,</a> you should 
        receive an acknowledgement that the paper has been successfully received.</p>
      <p>If you fail to receive an acknowledgement after submitting 
        your paper, please contact the editor-in-chief at <a href="mailto:najork%20(AT)%20microsoft%20(DOT)%20com">najork 
        &lt;at&gt; microsoft &lt;dot&gt; com </a>
        to verify that the submission has been received.</p>
      <p>A manuscript submitted for the first time might be accepted subjected to minor revisions or rejected, 
        but many published articles first receive a &quot;Revise and Resubmit&quot; 
        recommendation. If this happens, it may be very worthwhile to persevere, 
        revising the manuscript to fix problems and clarify misunderstandings. 
        Resubmissions should be accompanied with a cover letter that explains 
        in detail how the comments of the reviewers were dealt with.</p>

<h1>Author's Rights</h1>
<p>
  New options for ACM authors to manage rights and permissions for their
  work: ACM introduces a new publishing license agreement, an updated
  copyright transfer agreement, and a new author-pays option which
  allows for perpetual open access through the ACM Digital Library. For
  more information, visit the ACM Author Rights web page
  at <a href="http://authors.acm.org/">http://authors.acm.org</a>.
</p>

      <h1>ACM Author-Izer Service</h1>
        <p>
          You may wish to distribute your paper from your personal
          home page or your employer's institutional repository.
          ACM's Author-Izer Service extends ACM's support for
          self-archiving by enabling authors to generate and post
          links to the paper distributed from the ACM Digital Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several advantages to using ACM's Author-Izer
          Service. One advantage is that visitors to your personal
          bibliography pages download the definitive version of your
          paper for free from the ACM DL. A second advantage is that
          papers downloaded via links on your personal web page are
          recorded as part of your DL usage statistics, which improves
          the accuracy of impact measurements related to your paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          ACM's Author-Izer Service may be used for any paper that you have published with ACM. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A Summary Description of the Service and instructions for its use may be found at 
          <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service">http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service</a>.
