		<h2 id="sc"> Guidelines for Steering Committee</h2>

		<ul>
		<li>The steering committee consists of the program chairs of three ESA conferences and of four elected members.</li>

		<li> Program chairs serve for three years. The program chair of ESA (x) becomes a member of the steering committee at ESA(x-1) and retires at ESA(x+2).</li>

		<li> There are four elected members. Their term is four years.</li>

		<li> The committee elects its chairperson.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="pc"> Guidelines for Selection of Program Committee</h2>

		<p>The program chairs (one for each track) for ESA(x) are appointed by the
		steering committee at the steering committee meeting of ESA(x-2).</p>

		<p>
		The following guidelines for the selection of program committees
		were adopted by the business meeting of ESA. They are presented as precise rules;
		we stress however that they are meant as guidelines. In the following Israel is
		considered to be part of Europe. Program Committee is abbreviated as PC.
		</p>

		<ul class="enum">
		<li>Nobody should sit more than once in an ESA PC in a 5-year period, except, as a Chairperson. Furthermore, nobody should be a Chairperson more than once in a 10 year period. Past ESA editions (1993-1999) are included in the counting.</li>

		<li>If two candidates have comparable qualifications, precedence should be given to the person who has never been in an ESA or ICALP PC before. </li>

		<li>At least one third of the PC members must be young researchers (PhD at most 10 years before, including preferably people who got their PhD at most 5 years before) with a strong, generally recognised research record. </li>

		<li>No fixed geographical quotas within Europe are allowed. </li>

		<li>The jobs of Program Chair and Local Organizer are decoupled. </li>

		<li>The Program Chair selects the committee, trying to make sure that the above guidelines are followed and that all relevant research subareas are represented. A PC member is expected to attend the PC meeting and the conference.</li>

		<li>ESA wants to be a forum for algorithmicists in computer science and operations research. The composition of the program committees should reflect this goal.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="organizers"> Guidelines for ESA Organizers</h2>
    
    <p>In the year 2000 ESA was for the first time organized jointly with 
    several other conferences and workshops. Since 2001 it has been organized 
    in the context of ALGO.</p>

    <p>The following guidelines for the organization of ESA as part of ALGO 
    were established during the steering committee meeting at ESA 2004.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>It is the decision of the ESA organizers which conferences or
    workshops are organized jointly with ESA.</li>

    <li>There are a couple of plenary invited ALGO talks. The selection of
    invited plenary speakers is made by the organizers in close
    collaboration with the PC chairs of the ALGO conferences and
    workshops.</li>

    <li>There are no additional semi-plenary invited ESA talks. Semi-plenary 
    invited lectures of other ALGO conferences are not to be scheduled 
    in parallel with ESA talks.</li>

    <li>ESA talks are scheduled on three consecutive days only.</li>
  
    <li>The budget calculation for ESA/ALGO incorporates a moderate
    contribution to the expenses for a physical PC meeting of
    ESA. Details are negotiated with the PC chairs of ESA.</li>
    </ul>
