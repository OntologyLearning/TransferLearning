<h2><a name="scope"> 1. Scope</a></h2>
<p>
The ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS) publishes
significant papers on all aspects of computerized information systems.
The <a href="http://tois.acm.org/charter.html">Editorial
Charter</a> is available from the information server <a href="http://tois.acm.org">http://tois.acm.org</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="submissions"> 2. Submissions</a></h2>
<p>
Electronic submission should be made through Manuscript
Central, ACM's submission management system at <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tois">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tois</a>.
If it is your first time submitting a paper using this system, you will
need to create a new account (instructions can be found at the
website); otherwise, enter your login and password, choose
"Transactions on Information Systems" as the journal, and follow the
instructions provided for submitting your paper. We currently accept
electronic submissions in LaTeX and MS Word formats only. While there
is no
specific word limit for TOIS articles, papers tend to be in the 8,000
-12,000 word range. Submission will be acknowledged, and an Associate
Editor will be
assigned to process the manuscript. Authors are expected to maintain
current contact information in the Manuscript Central system. </p>
<p>For paper submissions, please email or call for instructions:</p>

<p><b> Originality</b>
<br>
Contributions appearing in ACM journals are normally original
papers that have not been published elsewhere. Publication of a paper
that has been widely disseminated is permitted only if the Editor
judges that the revision contains significant amplification or
clarification of the original material or there is some significant
additional benefit to be gained. Any prior appearance should be noted
on the title page and it is the obligation of the author to inform the
Editor-in-Chief if there are any circumstances concerning the
contribution that bear on this policy. Submission of a manuscript that
is under review by TOIS to another journal or conference without
approval of the Editor-in-Chief is considered to be unethical and, when
discovered, will result in immediate rejection by TOIS. </p>
<p>TOIS conforms to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and
<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions">Simultaneous
Submissions</a>, except
that TOIS usually defines "substantial revision" to mean that at
least 50% the paper is material that has not been published
previously.</p>
<h2><a name="paperlength">3. Paper Length</a></h2>
<p> TOIS does not have a maximum paper length, however its papers are
typically 25-30 pages long (excluding references) when the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions">recommended format</a>
is used. Authors considering papers longer than 40 pages (excluding
references) should contact the Editor-in-Chief prior to submission to
explain why a longer paper is appropriate for the topic. </p>
<h2><a name="styleguidelines">4. Style Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>
See <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions">http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions</a>
for formatting instructions and templates. Numbered
section headings should be used to facilitate readability. Language
which reflects prejudice (e.g., sexist language) should be avoided. The
introduction should clearly describe previous research on related
topics. Care should be taken to specify clearly all procedures
essential to the research. When a paper concerns a new piece of
software, comparisons to similar programs, benchmarks, and a discussion
of limitations should be included.</p>
<p>Generic names are preferred to specific product names.
However, when
they imply essential aspects of a procedure, as when a specific product
has unique features, the product names may be included for clarity.
Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to quote long passages
(60 words or more) from any material that appeared in a non-ACM
publication.
</p>
<h3>4.1 Title and Abstract</h3>
<p>Use a specific and informative title. Typically, a title might
contain 6 to 12 words. Avoid special symbols and formulas in titles
unless essential to indicate content. Authors' names should be given
without titles or degrees, along with the name of the sponsoring
organization. Current mailing addresses, including email addresses,
should be given in a footnote. </p>
<p>
The abstract should be 150 to 200 words long and should consist of
short, direct, and complete sentences. The abstract should state the
objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principal
conclusions. It should also indicate whether the focus is on
theoretical developments or on practical questions and whether subject
matter or method is emphasized. Avoid starting with the words, "This
paper". Work planned but not done should not be described in the
abstract. Because abstracts are often extracted from a paper and used
separately, avoid the use of the first person, display mathematics, and
citations. </p>
<h3>4.2 Aids for Classification</h3>
<p>
Categories and Subject Descriptors should be selected from the
classification system used by Computing Reviews (CR). The latest CR
classification was published in 1998. It is available at <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998">http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998</a>.
Use as many
descriptors as applicable.
</p>
<p>General Terms are those common to more than one area of
computing
and are chosen from the fixed list that accompanies the CR
classification system. </p>
<p>
Additional Keywords and Phrases consist of English language words that
may also be useful for indexing. These may be synonymous with terms in
the classification system, may be more specific than the subject
descriptors, or may not be covered by the existing system at all. In
this last case, use specific terms whose meaning is generally accepted
in the computing community. Do not use broad, catchall terms (such as
"computer," "system", or "automatic") and do not use private terms or
acronyms. For additional information, please read, "<a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/how-to-use">How to Use the
Computing Classification System.</a>"</p>
<h3>4.3 Mathematical and Symbolic Expressions</h3>
<p>Short mathematical equations and other expressions in the text
should be run in: (instead of each being displayed on a separate line).
Avoid exponents having more multiple levels of superscripting? $e sup
{x sup 2 + y sup 2}$, use $exp( x sup 2 + y sup 2 )$. Likewise, avoid
the use of built-up fractions in the text. For example, instead of ${1}
over { italic {n}}$, use either $1 / italic {n}$ or the negative
exponent form $italic {n} sup -1$. In display matter, however, built-up
fractions are preferred for clarity. Likewise, avoid small-type
mathematical expressions centered above or below arrows.
</p>
<p>If submitting hardcopy from a single-font printer, then
indicate
special marking for symbols (e.g., italics, boldface) and clearly
identify unusual symbols. </p>
<p>Equations that are referred to later in the text should be
numbered
sequentially and referred to, for instance, as Eq. 1. Do not number
equations that are not referred to in the text.
</p>
<h3>4.4 Statistics</h3>
<p>For empirical studies, the procedure should be presented in
sufficient detail to be replicated by other researchers. Statistical
tests should be included to support empirical claims. When reporting
statistics, the name of the statistic, the degrees of freedom, the
value obtained, and the p-value should be reported, e.g., F(3,65)=4.83,
p &lt; 0.01. </p>
<h3>4.5 Figures</h3>
<p>
Figures include graphs of results, schematic drawings, samples of
output screen dumps, and photographs of special equipment or displays.
Each figure should be numbered and have a caption. Upon publication,
figures will be reduced to 12.7cm (5 inches) in width. Care should be
taken to ensure that the legends and labels within the figure are large
enough to be readable after they are reduced. Acceptable figure file
formats are .tif, .gif, .jpg, .png, and .eps.</p>
<p>For final submissions on paper, high quality (at least 600 dpi)
figures should be included. Color prints can be reproduced, although
this adds to production costs and must be approved by the
Editor-in-Chief. </p>
<h3>4.6 Citations and the Reference List</h3>
<p>Relevant publications accessible to the public(i.e., articles
in
standard journals and open conference proceedings) should be cited.
References cited in the text should include the last name of the
author(s) and the year of publication, for example [Bush 1945] or
[Salton and McGill 1983]. When the citation(s) includes three or more
authors, only the first author should be mentioned by name (e.g.,
[Foley et al.1990]). A trailing lower case letter should distinguish
multiple papers by the same author(s)published during a single year,
for example[Winograd and Flores 1987a]. Multiple citations in the same
sentence should be enclosed within brackets and separated by
semicolons, for example, [Halasz 1988; VanRijsbergen 1975]. </p>
<p>
The reference list should be arranged alphabetically by the author's
last name, followed by the date. In the case of multiple listings by a
single author, the earliest publication appears first. When an author
is listed both as a single author and as a senior author with
coauthor(s),all of the single-author listings precede the
multiple-author listings, with the latter arranged alphabetically by
last name of successive authors. Again, chronological order is used for
multiple papers by the same set of authors. The lower case letter used
in the citation to distinguish multiple papers by the same author(s) in
the same year should be displayed in the reference list. </p>
<p>
References to items in periodicals: These should take the form: author,
title, journal, volume number, date, and pages. Author(s) should be
given last name first; likewise for editors, with the name followed by
(Ed.). The author's name always ends with a period, either the period
which follows the initial or a period specifically for that purpose. In
the title, only the first word and proper names (or their derivatives)
should be capitalized, and the title should end with a period. The year
is given in parentheses. For example: </p>
<blockquote>SCHWARTZ, J.T. Ultracomputers, ACM Trans. Program
Lang. Syst. 2, 4 (1980), 484-521.</blockquote>
<p>References to reports or proceedings: Author(s) and title-same style as for periodicals. This is followed by
the report number, source, date, and pages.
</p>
<p>References to books: Author(s)-same style as above. Title-all
principal words start with a capital letter. The title is followed by
the publisher, city, year, and any specific pages or chapters.
</p>
<h2><a name="onceaccepted"> 5. Once Accepted</a></h2>
<h3>5.1 Copyright and Use Agreement</h3>
<p>If the paper is acceptable after refereeing, each author will
be
asked to complete an ACM copyright form, either transferring copyright
to
ACM or declaring that the paper is part of government work. All author
rights forms are now filled electronically through the ACM e-Rights
Transfer Application. If your paper was submitted before April 2, 2013,
has recently been accepted, and you have not yet been contacted
concerning e-rights transfer, please send your manuscript number to
Laura Lander, Journals Manager, at lander@hq.acm.org.&nbsp; Authors
retain liberal rights to material published
by ACM.</p>
<p>
Abstracting of material in ACM publications is permitted with credit to
the source. Libraries are permitted to photocopy beyond the limits of
U.S. copyright law, for private use of patrons, those articles that
carry a code at the bottom of the first page, provided the per-copy fee
indicated in the code is paid through the Copyright Clearance Center
(P.O. Box 675,Schenectady, NY 12301 USA). Instructors are permitted to
photocopy isolated articles for noncommercial classroom use without
fee. The complete ACM Copyright Policy may be read <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>5.2 Proofs</h3>
<p>The first author will receive either galley or page proofs;
these
should be checked and returned promptly. Although the ACM staff
copyedits manuscripts, the author is solely responsible for marking
errors. Substantive changes should be approved by the Editor.</p><br>
