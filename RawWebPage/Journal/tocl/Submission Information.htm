<h1>ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL)</h1>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Submission Information</font></h2>

<h3>Where to submit?</h3>

<p>
Submissions of papers to ToCL are handled by the Manuscript Central tracking software (a system now used to manage all ACM Transactions). Please submit your paper by following this <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tocl">link</a>.  If you have not used Manuscript Central before, you will need to follow the "New User?" link on the right. If you have any problems making a submission, contact the Editor-in-Chief, <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/">Dale Miller</a>. Authors must specify one or two Area Editors in the field "Author Preferred Editors" or in their cover letter.
</p>

<p>
The ACM is one of several institutions that is starting to use the ORCID identification system of unique identifiers for researchers and scholars in order to improve the accuracy of bibliographic databases.  If you do not already have such an identifier when you upload a new submission to ManuscriptCentral, you will be asked to visit the ORCID web site in order to get such an identification.  For more about ORCID, visit <a href="http://about.orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid">http://about.orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid</a>.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions on your submission</h3>

<p>
Submitted manuscripts should not be published or simultaneously
submitted to another journal or to a conference.  Full (extended)
versions of important, published, conference papers are welcome.  Upon
acceptance of an article by the journal, the author(s) will be asked
to transfer copyright of the article to the ACM.
</p>

<p>
Submissions longer than 45 pages in the ACM style file format are
discouraged for the simple reason that TOCL publishes only 
approximately 1000 pages a year. The authors of such submissions, if 
they are accepted, will be asked to put part of their material in an 
electronic appendix.
</p>

<p>
To ensure timely processing of the submissions, whenever a paper needs
to be revised, the authors will be asked to prepare the revised
version within six months of receiving the reviews.
</p>

<p>
Many latex systems generate pdf files that are not properly handled by our
 document tracking system (ManuscriptCentral).  Prior to submitting your pdf 
files, please follow the <a href=pdf_distilling.html>instructions</a> for 
distilling pdf files into forms appropriate for ManuscriptCentral.
</p>

As of February 2013, the ACM has some new options for ACM authors to
manage rights and permissions for their work.  The ACM introduces a
new publishing license agreement, an updated copyright transfer
agreement, and a new author-pays option which allows for perpetual
open access through the ACM Digital Library. For more information,
visit the ACM Author Rights webpage at  
<a target="_top" href="http://authors.acm.org/">authors.acm.org</a>.

<h3>Parallel submission to the CoRR repository</h3>

<p>
We strongly recommend that authors of submitted paper also post their
paper to the <a href="http://arxiv.org/corr/home">Computing Research
Repository</a> (CoRR). The submissions to CoRR are publicly available
one day after the posting.  Your submission to this archiving service
can help our community have timely and convenient access to recently
written papers.  CoRR also allows new versions of papers to be added
to submitted papers so it is possible keep your entry at CoRR
synchronized with the one you submit to ToCL if the later is revised
during the reviewing process.
</p>

<p>
Such parallel submissions to CoRR is not a requirement for submission
to ToCL.
</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions about using CoRR</h3> 
<OL TYPE =1> 
<LI> 
If I submit a paper to TOCL via CoRR the information that I
submitted this paper to TOCL will become known to others.
So this is not an anonymous submission.
<P> 
Not quite so: Many papers posted at CoRR do not specify the current
status of the paper. Obviously, you do not need to mention in the
abstract or in the Comments field that the posted paper is submitted
to TOCL. 
<P> 
<LI> 
Why should I make the results of my research known to the
scientific community when they are not yet in a final form?
<P> 
If you submit a paper to TOCL, you are apparently convinced that it is
a high-quality contribution. Why not to let the others know the
results of your research immediately?
<P> 
<LI> 
Posting a paper at my home page or my home institution repository
will achieve the same effect.
<P> 
Not quite: Posting a paper at your home page or your home institution
repository does not lead to sending any information to any
subscription list.  Also, putting all the papers in one central
repository makes it easier to search for papers and link papers
together.
<P> 
<LI> 
In case I need to revise my submission to TOCL, CoRR will contain
the obsolete version of the paper.
<P> 
You can update the status of the paper you posted at CoRR
by posting the final version with any information you find relevant,
for instance that the paper will appear in TOCL.
<P> 
<LI> 
Isn't CoRR some new form of fad that is likely to disappear
in a couple of years?
<P> 
The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) archives of which CoRR
forms a part have been widely used since 1992 by the physicists and
mathematicians.  
The computer science part of the archives opened, in cooperation with
the ACM, in August 1998.
