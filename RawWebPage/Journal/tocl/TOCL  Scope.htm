<H1>ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL)</H1>

<H2><font color=#FF0000>Scope of the Journal</font></H2>

<P><BR>TOCL welcomes submissions related to all aspects of logic as it pertains to topics in computer science. 
This area has a great tradition in computer science. Several researchers who earned the ACM
Turing award have also contributed to this field, namely Edgar Codd (relational
database systems), Stephen Cook (complexity of logical theories), Edsger
W. Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, Tony Hoare, Amir Pnueli, and Dana Scott (program
logics, program derivation and verification, programming languages semantics),
Robin Milner (interactive theorem proving, concurrency calculi, and functional
programming), and John  McCarthy (functional programming and logics
in AI).
<P>Logic continues to play an important role in computer science and has
permeated several of its areas, including artificial intelligence, 
computational complexity, database systems, and programming languages.
<P>The <A HREF="editors.html">Editorial Board</A> of this journal seeks
and hopes to attract high-quality submissions in all the above-mentioned areas
of computational logic so that TOCL becomes the standard reference in the
field.
<P>Both theoretical and applied papers are sought. Submissions showing
novel use of logic in computer science are especially welcome.
<P>The following areas are currently covered by the members of the Editorial
Board. They may change as the field evolves.
In particular, submissions on the semantic aspects
of the mentioned topics are welcome.
