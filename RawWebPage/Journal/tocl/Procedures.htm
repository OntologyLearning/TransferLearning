<h2>
<font color="#FF0000">Procedures for Submitting Accepted Papers</font></h2>

<h3>Typesetting of accepted Papers</h3>

<p>
Please prepare your manuscript using LaTeX, and
follow <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions">ACM's
Guidelines for Submitting Accepted Articles</a>.  If your paper has an
electronic appendix then format it as explained in Section 8 of
the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/latex_style/instructions.pdf">instructions</a>.
</p>

<h3>Electronic submission of accepted papers</h3>

<p>
There are two sets of procedures for submitting accepted papers for
final publications.  
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Papers submitted to TOCL after 1 September 2010 are using the
<em>Manuscript Central</em> tracking system and that system will
provide authors with instructions for final submission.
</li>
<li>
Papers submitted to TOCL prior to 1 September 2010 are using
the <em>TOCL Editorial Office</em>.  In this case, follow the
instructions below.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submissions of accepted papers via the TOCL Editorial Office</h3>

<p>
For submissions that were not submitted via Manuscript Central:
The <font color="#FF0000">preferred</font> form of submitting the files
is by sending to the TOCL Editorial Office, <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="window.open(&#39;http://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=acm-tocl@cs.utexas.edu&#39;,&#39;Compose new message&#39;,&#39;width=640,height=480&#39;)" rel="noreferrer">acm-tocl@cs.utexas.edu</a>,
the URL address from which they can be fetched.
</p>

<p>
In the same email please send the precise address and email of
the <font color="#FF0000">corresponding author</font>. He/she will be
in charge of the galley proofs. 
</p>

<p>Please send the URL's of the following files: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>the PDF file that corresponds to the manuscript,</li>
<li>the single LaTeX2e file (so the .bbl file needs to be included in
        the .tex file), and the EPS files for all graphics (if there are
        many files in this group, please send a URL of a single gzipped
        tar file instead).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What happens after you submitted the files to the TOCL Editorial Office?</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The PDF file will be placed in the list
of <a href="http://tocl.acm.org/accepted.html">Accepted Papers</a> for
TOCL.
</li> 

<li>
The copyedited the manuscript will be sent from the ACM Headquarters to
the corresponding author for possible corrections.</li>

<li>
The corresponding author will be asked to process these corrections
in his/her LaTeX files and resubmit them to the TOCL Editorial Office in
the same way as originally.</li>
</ul>
