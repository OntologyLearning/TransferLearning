<H2><font color=#FF0000>Referee Instructions</font></H2>

The intention of the <A HREF="editors.html">Editorial Board</A> is
that TOCL becomes the standard reference in the field.  Therefore
submissions to TOCL must be of high quality and should fall within the
<A HREF="scope.html">scope</A> of the journal.

<P>

Theoretical papers should contain new and significant results. Applied
papers should demonstrate superiority compared to alternative
approaches.  All papers should be adequately motivated, and related
work should be properly described.

<P>
Please start your referee report by copying into it one of the
following four options:
<UL>
<LI>
Recommendation: This is an excellent paper and can be accepted for
TOCL as it is.
</LI>

<LI>
Recommendation: The paper can be accepted for TOCL after minor
revisions. No further refereeing round is needed.
</LI>

<LI>
Recommendation: The paper can eventually be accepted for TOCL. 
Another refereeing round is needed.
</LI>

<LI>
Recommendation: The paper does not meet the high standards set by 
TOCL, and unfortunately I recommend rejection.
<P>
</UL>
Your report, especially in the last case, should provide a clear 
explanation of your opinions.
<P>

Please remember that rejection of a paper is never a pleasant
experience, especially to young researchers who could easily get
discouraged by inconsiderate and offensive remarks.  Even if the paper
is not acceptable for publication, it still shows that the authors
spent considerable effort in carrying out their research and writing
their results down. Doing research is a noble activity.  Therefore
please avoid any possibly offensive remarks, and instead explain in
plain terms why the paper does not meet the standards of TOCL.

<P> 

Timely referee reports are crucial for the publication of
TOCL. Therefore you are kindly requested to complete your report
within two months.  

<P>

The preferred format for an anonymous referee's report is a plain
ASCII email message to the appropriate area editor.  The ACM has
professional copy editors, so please do not worry about correct
spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  A paper should not be rejected
merely because of bad English.

<P>
The Editorial Board is fully aware that refereeing papers is a 
time-consuming activity that one does for free. Therefore we appreciate
very much referees' work and are grateful for their help in
ensuring the high quality of TOCL.
