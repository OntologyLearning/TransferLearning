<h1>TOIT Reviewer Instructions</h1>

<p>This page is intended to describe the process of reviewing for TOIT.
Reviewers have a good deal of flexibility in what/how they write the
review.  However, the editorial board asks that the reviewer follow the
instructions below and remember two things: a) the authors will read the
reviews, so try to be constructive and polite, and b) try to be clear,
as in almost all cases the authors will craft their future efforts on
the reviewed work based on these comments.</p>

<h2>Review Criteria</h2>

<p>Each reviewer should assess whether the paper should be published in
TOIT.  What makes a paper publishable in TOIT?  There are really two
criteria. First, the paper content must be consistent with the subject
matter of TOIT.  Reviewers (and authors) are directed to the <A
HREF="subjects.html">subject page</A> for further detail, but generally
one should view any paper dealing with the middleware, applications, and
public policy associated with the Internet as being in scope.  When in
doubt, talk to the journal associate editors or its Editor-in-Chief.</p>

<P>The second part of the assessment asks, "Is this paper good science?"
 This assessment should provide at least answers to the following
questions:</p>

  <ol>
  
    <li>Is the problem addressed/studied in this paper well defined and
    articulated?</li>

    <li>Is the problem addressed/studied interesting enough to warrant
    publication?</li>

    <li>Is the methodology used appropriate for the problem
    addressed/studied?</li>

    <li>If this is a theoretical paper, does the level of rigor to
    support the result?  Are the theoretical devices (e.g., proofs)
    correct?</li>

    <li>If this is an empirical paper, are the measurements or analysis
    properly applied and the correct conclusions drawn?  Are there
    hidden factors that may invalidate the drawn conclusions?</li>

    <li>If this is a policy paper, does the paper offer insight into the
    policy issues and alternatives, and/or provide well reasoned
    critiques of  proposals?</li>

    <li>If this is a survey paper, is the coverage exhaustive, the
    presentation clear and accessible, and is the topic timely?</li>

  </ol>
  
<p>The answers to these questions will indicate whether the paper
usefully informs the TOIT technical community on some issue or problem
of current importance (and is thus potentially publishable).  If it
does, and does so clearly, completely, and convincingly, then the paper
is probably appropriate for publication.  It commonly takes  one or more
rounds of edits to direct the paper into publishable form (see
<A HREF="submission.html">editorial process</A>).  However, it is common
that the reviewer is able to determine whether it is likely that the
paper will ever be able reach that point on the first reading.</p>

<p><b>Re-review policy</b>: Each reviewer is responsible for assessing
the quality of paper revisions provided by the authors (via the editor).
Each revised paper should be reviewed to a level commensurate with the
modifications.  The re-review should contain a recommendation (as
below--accept without changes, minor revision, ...) and include
commentary identifying any remaining issues.  The reviewer is free to
downgrade a recommendation (potentially to reject) should he/she feel
that the revisions decreased the quality or appropriateness of the
paper.</p>

<h2>Report format</h2>

<p>The review should be returned to the editor by the deadline provided
in the initial invitation.  The review should be written in ASCII text
and included in an email (although some editors may allow other formats
such as Microsoft Word).  The reviewers should remain anonymous.  Note
that some editors may edit for clarity or structure before forwarding to
the EIC and authors, but will not change its intent.  The review
itself is commonly 100-300 lines of text, but in some cases can
considerably longer.  Shorter reviews are often a sign that the paper
has not been read deeply, and are strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>The report should include, at a minimum:</p>

<ol>

  <li>A 3-4 sentence overview of the work including
  its area, contribution, methodology, and results.</p>

  <li>Classification of the reviewer and paper:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>This paper is primarily a/an [ EMPIRICAL |
      THEORETICAL | PUBLIC POLICY | SURVEY ] paper.</p></li>

      <li>The reviewer is [ AN EXPERT | KNOWLEDGEABLE
      IN | AWARE OF | UNINFORMED OF ] the subject area.<p></li>

      <li>The methodology, analysis, description of
      related work, and technical explanations in this paper are [
      COMPLETELY SOUND | SLIGHTLY FLAWED | CONSIDERABLY FLAWED |
      INCORRECT ].</p></p>

      <li>The content of this paper is [ PERFECTLY
      ALIGNED | RELATED | TANGENTIAL| UNRELATED ] with/to TOIT subject
      areas.<p></li>

      <li>The editorial quality of the current
      version of this paper is [ FLAWLESS | EXCELLENT | FAIR | POOR
      ].<p></li>

      <li>The contribution made by the current
      version of this paper is [ GROUNDBREAKING | IMPORTANT | ORDINARY |
      SMALL | NONEXISTENT ].<p></li>

    </ul>

  <li>An overall recommendation for the paper.  These include:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Accept without modification</b> - the paper is publishable in
    its present form.  It is extraordinarily rare that a paper receives
    this rating on initial submission.</li>

    <li><b>Minor revision</b> - the paper requires minor modifications
    to the text and/or concepts.  Minor revisions generally include small
    editorial changes, addressing specific technical comments (with a
    paragraph or less), or the introduction of small amounts of
    additional detail on existing content. Receiving this rating
    <em>does not</em> ensure that the paper will be accepted for
    publication in TOIT, but is indicative of the editor's belief that
    the paper will be published.</li>

    <li><b>Major revision</b> - the paper needs major modifications to
    be publishable at TOIT.  Generally, any review that requires the
    introduction of new experiments or introduces substantially new
    content or exposition, or requires substantial editorial cleanup
    would be in this class.  Receiving this rating <em>does not</em>
    ensure that the paper will be accepted for publication in TOIT.</li>

    <li><b>Reject</b> - the paper is not appropriate for publication in
    TOIT.  No further modifications will be accepted or reviewed.</il>

  </ul>
  
  <li>Detailed comments for the reviewer on the
  paper.  These comments should be directed toward making the paper
  publishable, if possible.  The reviewer should clearly identify any
  conceptual, technical, or editorial issues that make the paper
  unpublishable.  Any related work that should be cited or referenced
  should be identified.  This is the main body of the review.</p>
