  <b>When Amazon Meets Google: Product Visualization by Exploring
    Multiple Web Sources</b><br>
  <i>Wang, Meng</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b>  
  Product visualization is able to help users easily get knowledge
  about the visual appearance of a product. In this paper, we present
  a novel product visualization approach that automatically collects a
  set of diverse and relevant product images by exploring multiple web
  sources. Our approach simultaneously leverages Amazon and Google
  image search engine, which represent domain-specific knowledge
  resource and general web information collection, respectively.  We
  propose a conditional clustering approach, which is formulated as an
  affinity propagation problem with regarding the Amazon examples as
  information prior.  The ranking information of Google image search
  results is also explored.

  <b>Resolvers Revealed: Characterizing DNS Resolvers and their
    Clients</b><br>
  <i>Shue, Craig; Kalafut, Andrew</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b>
  The Domain Name System allows clients to use resolvers to query a
  set of authoritative servers to translate host names into IP
  addresses. While prior work has examined the DNS from many angles,
  the resolver component has received little scrutiny. Essential
  factors for using a resolver in an access control system, such as
  whether a resolver is part of an ISP's infrastructure or running on
  an end-user's system, have not been examined. We examine DNS
  resolver behavior and usage, from query patterns and reactions to
  non-standard responses to passive association techniques to pair
  resolvers with their client hosts.

  <b>SafeVchat: A System for Obscene Content Detection in Online Video
    Chat Services</b><br>
  <i>Liang, Yu-Li; Xing, Xinyu; Cheng, Hanqiang; Dang, Jianxun; Huang,
    Sui; Han, Richard; Liu, Xue; Lv, Qin; Mishra, Shivakant</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b>  
  Recently, online video chat services, such as Chatroulette and
  Omegle that randomly match users in video chat sessions, are quickly
  emerging with over a million users per month in the case of
  Chatroulette. A key problem encountered in such systems is the
  presence of obscene content.  This paper presents SafeVchat, a novel
  solution which employs an array of visual feature detectors to
  detect misbehaving users. SafeVchat achieves high recall and
  precision when evaluated over real-world data. Besides, SafeVchat
  has been deployed in Chatroulette and offensive content has dropped
  significantly from 33.08% (before SafeVchat installation) to 3.49%
  (after SafeVchat installation).

  <b>User and ISP Rights of Device Attachment and Device
    Management</b><br>
  <i>Jordan, Scott; Shaffer, Gwen</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b>  
  Internet research often assumes users may connect devices without
  consent by their service providers. However, in many networks the
  service provider only allows use of devices obtained directly from the
  provider. We review how United States communications law addresses the
  rights of users to connect devices of their choice. We explicate a set
  of user and service provider rights. We propose legal requirements for
  attachment and management of devices. We illustrate how these proposed
  regulations would affect the services currently offered on telephone,
  cable, satellite, video networks, and cellular networks, as well as on
  the Internet.

  <b>A Server-Side Authenticated Key-Establishment with Low
    Computational Workload</b><br>
  <i>Oligeri, Gabriele; Bicakci, Kemal; Crispo, Bruno</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b>  
  Server-side authenticated key-establishment protocols are
  characterized by demanding a heavy workload to the server. We propose
  LAKE: a new protocol that allows to amortize server's workload peaks
  by moving most of the computational burden to the clients. We provide
  a formal analysis of the LAKE protocol under the Canetti-Krawczyk
  model and prove it as secure under such a model. Finally, we show the
  efficiency of our protocol through extensive measurements on a real
  client-server pair. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most
  computationally efficient authenticated key-establishment ever
  proposed in literature.
