   <h3><a name="scope">Scope</a></h3>
   <p>
    As explained in the <a href="charter.html">Editorial Charter</a>,
    ACM Transactions on Graphics publishes papers of significant and lasting value
    in all areas of computer graphics, including (but not limited to) the following.

   <h3><a name="categories">Submission categories</a></h3>
   <p>
    TOG accepts manuscript submissions in these categories:
   </p>
   <ul class="longlist">

    <li><em>Previously unpublished research paper.</em>
     These can include material presented as a SIGGRAPH Sketch or in a workshop,
     symposium or conference so long as it was not published in a journal.
     (Any such prior presentation must be cited.)
    </li>

    <li><em>SIGGRAPH accept with major revision.</em>
     Some papers submitted to the SIGGRAPH conference are sufficiently compelling
     to warrant acceptance, but would require more revision than the few weeks the
     SIGGRAPH conference schedule permits. The SIGGRAPH Papers Committee recommends
     these papers for acceptance with major revision to appear in an
     upcoming issue of TOG. These manuscripts once revised are submitted to TOG
     under this category for verification of the revisions and eventual publication.
    </li>

    <li><em>Resubmission of SIGGRAPH paper requesting reviewer continuity.</em>
     If a paper has previously been rejected from a SIGGRAPH conference,
     the authors may request that the original SIGGRAPH reviewers examine the revised paper,
     in order to improve continuity of the review process.
     The SIGGRAPH organization will forward the reviews and reviewer names to a TOG associate editor,
     who will coordinate the process and make the acceptance recommendation.
     This type of submission must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes made
     since the earlier SIGGRAPH submission.
     Also, be sure to include the original paper title if it has changed.
    </li>
   </ul>


   <h3><a name="policies">Publication policies</a></h3>
   <p>
    The <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies">ACM Publications Policies</a>
    page addresses issues of plagiarism, copyrights, simultaneous submissions, etc.
   </p>


   <h3><a name="format">Format</a></h3>
   <p>
    We prefer manuscripts submitted as PDF files, but can also accept PostScript
    or Microsoft Word documents.
   </p>
   <p>
    Documents should follow the formatting of the sample paper in
    <a href="acm-tog.zip">this ZIP file</a> so that we can properly assess page count.
    Note that the format of ACM TOG differs from that of other ACM Transactions
    in that it follows the two-column style of the SIGGRAPH Proceedings.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instructions and style files for formatting a submission using
    LaTeX are present in <a href="acm-tog.zip">the same ZIP file</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because TOG has page count constraints, authors are encouraged to keep the presentation concise.
    For instance, figures and tables should be formatted to span only a single column rather than both columns if
    possible.
    Also, it may be appropriate to place content in supplementary electronic material that accompanies the submission.
    Such supplementary material is made available with the paper in the ACM Digital Library after the paper is
    published.
   </p>


   <h3><a name="process">Process</a></h3>
   <p>
    TOG accepts submissions electronically via
    <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tog">Manuscript Central</a>.
    Authors should go there, create an account and password, login selecting "Transactions on Graphics",
    and proceed to the Author Center to submit a manuscript.
   </p>
   <p>
    A submitted paper must overcome several hurdles in its quest for publication in
    ACM Transactions on Graphics.
   </p>
   <ul class="longlist">
    <li>An administrative assistant first checks the submission for completeness
     and notifies the Editor-in-Chief.
    </li>
    <li>The Editor-in-Chief then determines if the paper is appropriate for
     consideration by TOG and, if so, assigns it to an Associate Editor.
    </li>
    <li>The Associate Editor reads the paper and further determines if it is
     appropriate for TOG consideration, and if so, selects several referees.
    </li>
    <li>The referees read the submission and measure its novelty, impact and
     correctness, and each returns a review to the Associate Editor.
    </li>
    <li>The Associate Editor collects the reviews and makes a recommendation to
     the Editor-in-Chief on the acceptability of the submission.
    </li>
    <li>The Editor-in-Chief, based on the reviews and Associate Editor's
     recommendation, makes a final, binding recommendation on the acceptability of
     the submission, and communicates to the author this recommendation along with
     the Associate Editor's comments and referees reviews.
    </li>
    <li>For papers on which the Editor-in-Chief has a conflict,
     the role of Editor-in-Chief is assigned to the Past-Editor-in-Chief.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Our goal is to get your submission out to the graphics community as soon as possible.
   </p>
   <ul class="longlist">
    <li>We strive to complete this process from submission to decision in
     <em>3 months</em>, and our average
     time is 2.5 months from submission to decision, though some papers can require
     longer periods to perform the complete and thorough evaluation required by the
     top journal in computer graphics.
    </li>
    <li>If at any time during this process we determine your submission is
     inappropriate for consideration by TOG, we will return the submission to the
     author immediately so the problem can be fixed or the submission can be sent
     to a more appropriate venue. This is in the best interest of the author and the timely publication of the submission as it avoids a lengthy review process
     that would nevertheless result in rejection.
    </li>
    <li>Once a paper is accepted, we immediately make the entire paper freely
     available on the TOG website, until its TOG issue is physically published and
     it becomes available in the ACM Digital Library.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The journal submission process is unlike that of a conference, workshop or symposium.
   </p>
   <ul class="longlist">
    <li>There is <em>no deadline</em>.  Submit your manuscript when it is ready.</li>
    <li>There is <em>no page limit</em>.  Use the least number of pages necessary to adequately describe your idea.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    For assistance, please contact the <a href="editors.html">Assistant to the Editor-In-Chief</a>.
   </p>


   <h3><a name="recommendations">Recommendations</a></h3>
   <p>
    Your submission will be returned with one of the following recommendations:
   </p>
   <ul class="longlist">
    <li><em>Accept as is.</em>
     The submission will appear in an upcoming issue of ACM Transactions on
     Graphics.
    </li>
    <li><em>Accept with minor revisions.</em>
     If the author implements the requested
     revisions, the revised submission will appear in an upcoming issue. The
     revisions will be verified by the Associate Editor.
    </li>
    <li><em>Accept with major revisions.</em>
     If the author implements the requested
     revisions, the revised submission will appear in an upcoming issue. The
     revisions will be verified by the original referees.
    </li>
    <li><em>Provisional reject.</em>
     The author is encouraged to submit a revised version of the
     manuscript, but there is no guarantee that even if the requested revisions
     were successfully performed that the submission would be accepted. There may
     be additional revisions necessary beyond the ones originally requested.
    </li>
    <li><em>Reject.</em>
     The author is encouraged to submit the manuscript elsewhere, or
     the manuscript does not yet meet the standards of breadth, impact, novelty or
     correctness required for publication by the number one journal in computer
     graphics.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    An accept with revisions decision is contingent on the timely submission of a
    revised manuscript, to ensure the novelty of the contribution. We expect
    authors to submit revised manuscripts within six months of the decision,
    unless a request for an extension is granted by the Editor-in-Chief.
   </p>
