  <div class="feature"> 
  Papers must be of high quality and fall within the scope of the journal. There
    are four main ingredients for a paper to be acceptable:
  <ul>
  <li>validity; </li>
  <li>novelty; </li>
  <li>relevance; </li>
  <li>presentation. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Few papers excel in all of these, but a substandard level in any of the
	four ingredients is sufficient grounds for rejection. Many papers require
	substantial revisions before acceptance, and reviewers should not
	hesitate to recommend that a paper be rejected pending changes that are
	required for completeness, correctness, or to substantially improve
	clarity. The most important elements of the review are the
	Recommendation and the Detailed Comments. </p>

  <p>Rarely do all reviewers agree on a submission, so detailed comments of the
	merits and deficiencies of a paper are needed. If you like the paper
	immensely, do not assume other reviewers will. Describe in detail what
	you think is important about it, how it will contribute to theory or
	practice. If you are sure the paper should be rejected, you should
	explain why, politely but in detail, because other reviewers may
	recommend acceptance. Often, first submissions receive a Revise and
	Resubmit recommendation; for the authors of these papers, your detailed
	points will be of tremendous use in guiding the revision of their
	work. </p>

<p>For a long paper (15 journal pages or greater, and designated as a "long paper"
upon submission) it is expected that the paper will present <em>substantial</em> new
results. Examples of substantial new results would be a totally new approach to
a problem, application of known techniques to an interesting new problem in
Asian language information processing, or the development of a substantial new
resource of use to the community.</p>

<p>
For a short paper (typically 5-10 journal pages and designated as a "short
paper" upon submission), the expectations are less extensive: the paper may
merely report on a single experiment, or it may discuss a problem with a
previous technique published in the literature. Nonetheless the paper must still
show some demonstrable result, and not consist just of theoretical speculation.</p>


  <p>The tone of your review is very important to our efforts to create a
  community of scholars and practitioners. When you write an anonymous review,
  you are acting as a representative of the professional information processing 
  field. It is always possible to be constructive and firm without being
  hostile. Keep in mind that often the problem could be primarily in
  communication. Even in the worst case, where the work cannot be salvaged, one
  can explain how the author(s) could do a better job in the future. </p>
