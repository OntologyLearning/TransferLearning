  <div class="feature"> The following page contains important information about
  the submission process for TALIP, the review process, various ACM author tools
  and services, and the <a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> global researcher
  registry. Prospective authors are strongly encouraged to read this entire
  page.  </div>

  <div class="feature"> 
    <h2><a name=scope>1. Scope</a></h2>

    <p>TALIP primarily consists of original research papers reporting
	substantial research findings. Papers describing reproducible techniques
	and theory for systems and applications are considered.
	Descriptions of specific products with no proof of
	reproducibility are not appropriate for TALIP.</p>

    <p>TALIP covers all areas of Asian language information processing,
	including theory, systems design, evaluation, and applications.
	Emphasis will be placed on the originality and relevance of theory,
	technology, and applications in the field.</p> </div>
 
  <div class="feature"> 
    <h2><a name=submissions>2. Submission</a></h2>

    <p>Please submit papers in PDF format using the <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/talip">web-based submission system Manuscript Central</a>. </p> 

    <p>TALIP is electronically produced, so it is imperative that all manuscripts 
	submitted for publication in TALIP be prepared in electronic format. Articles published in TALIP are prepared for both print and digital display in the ACM 
	Digital Library. Instructions on preparing your manuscript for submission to 
	TALIP are available at:</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions">
	http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions</a></p>

<p> Papers submitted to TALIP are of two categories. The author should specify
the category of the submission at the time the manuscript is submitted: </p>

<ul>

  <li> Long papers: These must be at least 15 journal pages in length and must
describe substantial research results either in terms of experiments, new
findings and/or substantial resources of use to the research community.  </li>

  <li> Short papers: These are typically between 5 and 10 journal pages in
length. Short papers may report small experiments that are not substantial
enough for a long paper, or may, for example, document problems with previously
published research.  </li>

</ul>

<p> <b><font color="red">A submitted paper that obviously does not conform to the requirements listed
above and does not meet the subject-matter requirements described in the <a
href="charter.htm">editorial charter</a> will be rejected without review.</font>
</b>  </p>

<p> The Editor-in-Chief will assign each submission to an Associate Editor
with expertise in the appropriate area. The Associate Editor will be responsible
for obtaining at least three reviews of the paper and make a recommendation to
the Editor-in-Chief. According to the recommendation, the Editor-in-Chief will
decide whether to publish the paper.  Note that both categories of papers will
be rigorously reviewed with an eye to what the contribution of the paper is to
the field of Asian language information processing.  </p>

<p>To ensure proper indexing, classification, retrieval, and dissemination,
authors must include the following in the manuscript: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>Title </li>

</ul>

	<p>TALIP requires a submitted paper to have at least 25% new content
	when compared to a previously published version of the paper in a
	conference or workshop. TALIP strives to provide a quick turnaround
time. In 2013, for example, the mean turnaround time from submission
	to first decision was under 60 days.</p>

        <p><b>In addition, authors who are <em>resubmitting</em> papers that
        have previously been reviewed and returned to the authors should bear
        the following in mind:</b> Papers are assigned a category which is one
        of Accept, Minor Revision, Major Revision, Reject &amp; Resubmit and
        Reject. If a paper that has been assigned to the "Major Revision" or
        "Reject &amp; Resubmit" category on the first review is resubmitted,
        that paper must be deemed to merit a category better than "Major
        Revision" upon the second review. If it does not, then the paper will be
        rejected.  This policy is in place in the interests of conserving
        reviewer resources and not spending them on papers that are only
        incrementally improved at each review cycle.</p>



  </div> 
  <div class="feature"> 
    <h2><a name=style_guidelines>3. Style Guidelines</a></h2>

    <p>Numbered section headings should be used to facilitate readability. The
	article should clearly describe previous research on related
	topics. Care should be taken to specify clearly all procedures essential
	to the research. When a paper concerns a new piece of software,
	comparisons to similar programs, benchmarks, and a discussion of
	limitations should be included. </p>


    <p>Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to quote long passages
    (60 words or more) from any material that appeared in a non-ACM
    publication. </p> 

<p> <strong>3.1 Title and Abstract</strong></p>

    <p>Use a specific and informative title. Typically, a title contains from 6
	to 12 words. Avoid special symbols and formulas in titles unless
	essential to indicate content. Authors' names should be given without
	titles or degrees, along with the affiliated organizations. Current
	mailing addresses, including email addresses, should be given in a
	footnote. </p>

  <p>The abstract should be 150 to 200 words long and should consist of short,
    direct, and complete sentences. The abstract should state the objectives of
    the work, summarize the results, and give the principal conclusions. It
    should also indicate whether the focus is on theoretical developments or on
    practical questions and whether subject matter or method is
    emphasized. Avoid starting with the words "This paper." Work planned but not
    done should not be described in the abstract. Because abstracts are often
    extracted from a paper and used separately, avoid the use of the first
    person, display mathematics, and citations.  </p>

      <strong>3.2 Aids for Classification</strong>    

    <p>Categories and Subject Descriptors should be selected from the ACM
    Computing Classification System (CCS), which can be found at <a
     href="http://www.acm.org/class/1998/">http://www.acm.org/class/1998/</a>. Use
    as many descriptors as applicable. General Terms are those common to more
    than one area of computing and are chosen from the fixed list that
    accompanies the classification system. </p>

  <p>Additional Keywords and Phrases consist of English language words that may
	also be useful for indexing. These may be synonymous with terms in the
	classification system, may be more specific than the subject
	descriptors, or may not be covered by the existing system at all. In
	this last case, use specific terms whose meaning is generally accepted
	in the computing community. Do not use broad, catchall terms (such as
	<i>computer, system, or automatic</i>) and do not use private terms or
	acronyms.

    </p>
      <strong>3.3 Mathematical and Symbolic Expressions</strong>    

    <p>Short mathematical equations and other expressions in the text should be
    run in (instead of each being displayed on a separate line). Avoid
    exponents having multiple levels of superscription: instead of <i>e sup {x sup 2 + y sup
    2}</i>, use <i>exp (x sup 2 + y sup 2)</i>. Likewise, avoid the use of built-up
    fractions in the text. For example, instead of <i>{1} over {n}</i>, use
    either <i>1 / n</i> or the negative exponent form <i>n sup -1</i>. In
    display matter, however, built-up fractions are preferred for
    clarity. Likewise, avoid small-type mathematical expressions centered above
    or below arrows. </p>

  <p>Equations that are referred to later in the text should be numbered
    sequentially and referred to, for instance, as Eq. 1. Do not number
    equations that are not referred to in the text.  </p>

      <strong>3.4 Statistics</strong>    

      <p>For empirical studies, the procedure should be presented in sufficient
      detail to be replicated by other researchers. Statistical tests should be
      included to support empirical claims. When reporting statistics, the name
      of the statistic, the degrees of freedom, the value obtained, and the
      p-value should be reported, e.g., F(3,65) = 4.83, p &lt; 0.01.

    </p>
      <strong>3.5 Figures</strong>  

      <p>Figures include graphs of results, schematic drawings, samples of
    output, screen, and photographs of special equipment or displays. Each
    figure should be numbered and have a caption. Upon publication, figures will
    be reduced to approximately 12.7 cm (5 inches) in width. Care should be
    taken to ensure that the legends and labels within the figure are large
    enough to be readable after they are reduced. For final submissions, high
    quality (at least 600 dpi) figures should be included. Color prints can be
    reproduced, although this adds to production costs and must be approved by
    the Editor-in-Chief.  </p>

      <strong>3.6 Citations and the Reference List</strong>    

      <p>Relevant publications accessible to the public (i.e., articles in
      standard journals and open conference proceedings) should be
      cited. References cited in the text should include the last name of the
      author(s) and the year of publication, for example [Bush 1945] or [Salton
      and McGill 1983]. When the citation(s) includes three or more authors,
      only the first author should be mentioned by name (e.g., [Foley et
      al. 1990]). A trailing lower case letter should distinguish multiple
      papers by the same author(s) published during a single year, for example
      [Winograd and Flores 1987a]. Multiple citations in the same sentence
      should be enclosed within brackets and separated by semicolons, for
      example, [Halasz 1988; VanRijsbergen 1975]. </p>

  <p>The reference list should be arranged alphabetically by the author's last
  name, followed by the date. In the case of multiple listings by a single
  author, the earliest publication appears first. When an author is listed both
  as a single author and as a senior author with coauthor(s), all of the
  single-author listings precede the multiple-author listings, with the latter
  arranged alphabetically by last name of successive authors. Again,
  chronological order is used for multiple papers by the same set of
  authors. The lowercase letter used in the citation to distinguish multiple
  papers by the same author(s) in the same year should be displayed in the
  reference list. </p>

      <p>References to items in periodicals: These should take the form: author, title, journal, volume number, date, and pages. Author(s) should be given last name first; likewise for editors, with the name followed by (Ed.). The author's name always ends with a period, either the period that follows the initial or a period specifically for that purpose. This is followed by the year. In the title, only the first word and proper names (or their derivatives) should be capitalized, and the title should end with a period. For example: </p>
      <p>SCHWARTZ, J.T. 1980 Ultracomputers, ACM Trans. Program Lang. Syst. 2, 4 , 484-521. </p>
      <p>References to reports or proceedings: </p>
      <p>Author(s) and title - same as for periodicals. This is followed by the report number, source, date, and pages. </p>
      <p>References to books: Author(s) - same as above. Title - all principal words start with a capital letter. The title is followed by the publisher, city, year, and any specific chapters or pages. <br>

  <div class="feature"> <h2><a name="orcid">6. ORCID</a></h2> <p>ORCID is a
    community-based effort to create a global registry of unique researcher
    identifiers for the purpose of ensuring proper attribution of works to their

    now asked to add their ORCID unique researcher identifier to their record.
    They can obtain their number from the <a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID
    registration site</a>. The ORCID ID then becomes part of the manuscript's
    metadata and will be passed back into ACM's Digital Library if the
    manuscript is accepted for publication. ACM has not yet made ORCID
    registration a requirement of submission, but intends to do so in the near
