<h2>Information for Authors</h2>

  <p>
  <a name="Submissions"><h4>Submissions</h4></a>
  Submit your paper using <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/acm/tocs/" target="_blank"> ACM manuscript central</a>.  (If you need an account, select "Create Account" in the top right corner.)  To ensure proper indexing, classification, retrieval and dissemination, authors must include the following in the manuscript:
   <ul>
   <li> Descriptive title
   <li> Author names and affiliations
   <li> Abstract
   <li> Content indicators
   <li> Citations to relevant literature
   </ul>
For the full classification scheme, see <a href="http://www.acm.org/class/1998"> The ACM Computing Classification System</a>.<br>

  <p>
  Many manuscripts submitted to ACM Transactions on Computer Systems are based on the author's own previous publications (e.g., conference papers).  Such manuscripts should contain a footnote on the first page that lists the authors' relevant prior publications and states the contributions of the manuscript beyond these publications.  The norm for ACM Journals and Transactions is that the submitted manuscript must contain at least 25% new content (i.e., new
insights, new results, etc.).  For more details, see <a href=http://www.acm.org/pubs/sim_submissions.html>Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions</a> and <a href=http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy>ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism</a>. <br>

  <a name="Formatting"><h4>Formatting</h4></a>
   Please prepare you submission  in LaTex or Word formatted in the ACM style which is required for publication in TOCS.  Instructions for these formats are on the ACM Web site:<br
     <ul>
     <li> <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style" target="_blank"> Latex style guide</a></li> 
     <li><a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/word_style/word-style-toc/" target="_blank"> Microsoft Word style guide </a></li> 
     </ul>

   When the paper is accepted for publication ACM requires the following files:
       <ol>
       <li> <font color="#006600">source files</font> in either LaTeX or Microsoft Word, including:
			<ol type="a">
			<li> <a href="http://www.acm.org/class/1998">Computing 		Classification System</a> Terms
			<li> General Terms, one or more of the <a href="http://www.acm.org/class/1998">fixed 16 Terms</a> 
			<li> Additional Keywords and Phrases
			</ol>
       <li> full paper in <font color="#006600"> PDF</font>; and
       <li> <font color="#006600">(eps)</font> encapsulated individual postscript <font color="#006600">files</font> for all graphics (eps of all figures are needed in case ACM may need to resize the figures after the source file conversion). Other acceptable formats are gif, tif, or jpg but eps is preferred.
        </ol>

  Authors may bundle the above files and just send one file to the Editor-in-Chief. Please let us know how you bundled them so that we can unbundle the files here for final examination before forwarding to ACM Headquarters for publication.
