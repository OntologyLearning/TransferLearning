"'Stephen Cameron obtained his PhD in Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh University, working on the geometric modelling of robots and on collision detection. His general area of interest is in spatial reasoning, although this covers a wide range which includes the planning of tasks and motions for robot vehicles and manipulators, the use of geometric models, and the scheduling of fleets of robots. Some of his work is in collaboration with members of the Oxford University Robotics Research Group in the Department of Engineering Science. He is a member of the AISB, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, the Geometric Modelling Society, the IAM and CAMRA.",'1-2-1-2-1-1-2-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
