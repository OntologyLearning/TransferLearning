"'I completed my Ph.D. thesis in the area of data-parallel algorithms for model checking at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic in Jun 2012. In spring 2011, I spent 5 months in the Software Technologies Research Group at the Otto-Friedrich-University of Bamberg, Germany as a research assistant and a lecturer in the area of parallel programming under supervision of prof. Gerald Luttgen.  Since July 2012, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the Systems Biology Laboratory at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University under supervision of prof. Lubos Brim. Currently, I am a visiting postdoctoral researcher at Department of Computer Science at Oxford University in the group led by prof.
