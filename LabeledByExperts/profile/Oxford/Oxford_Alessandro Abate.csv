"'I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. I received a Laurea degree in Electrical Engineering (summa cum laude) in October 2002 from the University of Padova. As an undergraduate I also studied at UC Berkeley and RWTH Aachen. I earned an MS in May 2004 and a PhD in December 2007, both in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, at UC Berkeley, working on Systems and Control Theory with S. Sastry. Meanwhile I was an International Fellow in the CS Lab at SRI International in Menlo Park (CA). Thereafter, I have been a PostDoctoral Researcher at Stanford University, in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, working with C. Tomlin on Systems Biology in affiliation with the Stanford School of Medicine. From June 2009 to mid 2013 I have been an Assistant Professor at the Delft Center for Systems and Control, TU Delft - Delft University of Technology, working with my research group on Verification and Synthesis over complex systems and on Systems Biology.",'1-2-1-2-1-1-2-1-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
