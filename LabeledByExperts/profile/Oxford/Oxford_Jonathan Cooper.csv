"'I am interested in the application of software engineering to computational biology - using technology well to enable better science. In particular, I look at the use of domain-specific languages to describe mathematical models of biology, and the tools required to make these usable for researchers. My doctorate, and some subsequent work, looked at automating both the validation and optimisation of biological (in particular, cardiac) models described using the CellML language (of which I am an elected editor). I have worked in several EU projects within the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) initiative, focusing on standards-based interoperability and the development of modelling tools.",'1-2-1-2-1-1-2-1-1-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
"'My current research interests lie in developing the concept of ""functional curation"", which supports the specification of experiments through a protocol language, allowing an in silico version of a wet lab experiment to be run on a range of alternative models and the results compared. This has the potential to transform our approach to modelling, putting the integration of models and data on a rigorous footing, and facilitating the model development process.",'1-2-1-2-1-1-2-1-1-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I

Over the next 3 years I also worked on two other projects within the Virtual Physiological Human initiative: preDiCT, which looked at predicting the cardiac toxicity of drugs, and TUMOR, working on transatlantic integration of cancer models.
