"'TALIP is also open to articles that provide literature and/or technology reviews in one of the above-mentioned areas. However, in order to be considered for publication, such an article must demonstrate that it provides information that is substantially different from what is available in the literature. The author(s) of review articles must submit a cover letter that clearly states why they believe their contribution adds useful material not covered elsewhere. Also, a review article should not just be a summarization of previous work: it must also be a work of exegesis. That is, the author(s) must show how the different strands of work relate to each other. They should also offer a view of where the field under review is going. A survey or review article submitted to TALIP will go through the usual review process only if the editors feel the submission adheres to the above guidelines.",'1-2-1-2-5,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,N

Submissions will be shared with the Associate Editors for discussion. In rare instances, if the submission involves substantial technical content, we will ask an outside reviewer for assistance.",'1-2-1-2-6,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,N
