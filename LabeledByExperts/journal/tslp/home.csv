"'IEEE and ACM are pleased to announce that the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing and the ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing will be published jointly as the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, starting January 2014. Papers from the new Transactions will appear in both IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library. Publication will be managed by IEEE as a hybrid journal, allowing either traditional or open access manuscript submission. The new journal welcomes novel contributions in all areas covered by the two journals, which includes audio, speech, and language processing and the sciences that support them.",'1-1-1-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,I
