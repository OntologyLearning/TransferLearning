"'ACM does permit an EiC to be an author of a paper in the EiC’s journal. Outright prohibition of EiC authorship is considered too severe for at least three reasons: First, it can unduly penalize the EiC’s coauthors. In several computing disciplines, the ACM Transactions is the premier – and sometimes the only – high-quality, archival venue for research publication. A strict prohibition would impact the EiC’s coauthors, especially if they were just starting their research careers. Second, a general prohibition could prevent some high-quality papers from appearing in ACM journals. ACM’s stated mission is to be the publisher of choice. Good work should be evaluated on its merits and not on the basis of authorship. Third, a prohibition could be a disincentive for leading researchers to serve as EiC, especially insofar as this prohibition would affect coauthors, in particular graduate students.",'1-2-2-4-2-2-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I
