"'Originality. Contributions appearing in ACM journals are normally original papers that have not been published elsewhere. Publication of a paper that has been widely disseminated is permitted only if the Editor judges that the revision contains significant amplification or clarification of the original material or there is some significant additional benefit to be gained. Any prior appearance should be noted on the title page and it is the obligation of the author to inform the Editors-in-Chief if there are any circumstances concerning the contribution that bear on this policy. Submission of a manuscript that is under review by TAAS to another journal or conference without approval of the Editors-in-Chief is considered to be unethical and, when discovered, will result in rejection by TAAS.",'1-2-2-2-1-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
