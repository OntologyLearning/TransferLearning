"'Few papers excel in all of these, but a substandard level in any of the four ingredients is sufficient ground for rejection.

"'More specific criteria apply to papers presenting theoretical results, which has been a particular issue in distributed or parallel computing. ACM TOCS does not accept papers that belong in more theoretical journals (e.g. JACM, Springer-Verlag's ""Distributed Computing"", Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing). This does not imply that all theoretical papers are to be rejected; rather it implies that theoretical papers that cannot establish their direct relevance to current issues in the development of computer systems will generally be rejected. An acceptable paper of this type should contain:",'1-1-2-2-4,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,C
