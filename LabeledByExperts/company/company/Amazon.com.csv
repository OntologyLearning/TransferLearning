He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, due to the large world-wide demand for literature, the low price points for books, along with the huge number of titles available in print.

Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand, telling a reporter, ""There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time. But you know, McDonald's got copied.

In July 1995, the company began service and sold its first book on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought. In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public. In 1996, it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public offering of stock on May 15, 1997, trading under the NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN, at a price of US$18.00 per share ($1.50 after three stock splits in the late 1990s).",'1-1-2-1-1-2-1-1-1-2-2-1-2-6,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,1,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
"'Amazon's initial business plan was unusual; it did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This ""slow"" growth caused stockholders to complain about the company not reaching profitability fast enough to justify investing in, or to even survive in the long-term. When the dot-com bubble burst at the start of the 21st Century, destroying many e-companies in the process, Amazon survived, and grew on past the bubble burst to become a huge player in online sales. It finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $5 million (i.e., 1¢ per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed. In 1999, Time magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year, recognizing the company's success in popularizing online shopping.",'1-1-2-1-1-2-1-1-1-2-2-1-2-7,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I

In a German television report broadcast in February 2013, journalists Diana Löbl and Peter Onneken conducted a covert investigation at the distribution center of Amazon in the town of Bad Hersfeld in the German state of Hesse. The report highlights the behavior of some of the security guards, themselves being employed by a third party company, who apparently either had a Neo-nazi background or deliberately dressed in Neo-Nazi apparel, and who were intimidating foreign and temporary female workers at its distribution centres. The third party security company involved was delisted by Amazon as a business contact shortly after that report.",'1-1-2-1-1-2-1-3-1-6-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,I
