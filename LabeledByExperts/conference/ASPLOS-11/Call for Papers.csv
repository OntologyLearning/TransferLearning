"'ASPLOS is a forum for multidisciplinary research that spans the boundaries of hardware, computer architecture, compilers, languages, operating systems, networking, and applications. The ASPLOS conference series has captured some of the major computer systems innovations of the past two decades (e.g., RISC and VLIW processors, small and large-scale multiprocessors, clusters, optimizing compilers, network-storage systems, and system-level and language-level virtualization).",'1-1-2-2-2-1-1-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,N
"'Computer systems today face great challenges and exciting opportunities, due to the end of single-processor performance scaling, new demands imposed by mobile and petascale computing, and the increasing need for energy efficiency across the computing spectrum. Multidisciplinary research is increasingly important as boundaries between hardware/software and local/network computing blur, as the form and capabilities of computing devices becomes ever more varied, and as users and applications continue to expand. In addition to the main program, this ASPLOS will offer tutorials and workshops on a variety of topical areas.",'1-1-2-2-2-1-1-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,N
"'Like its predecessors, ASPLOS 2011 will focus on ground-breaking research, with an emphasis on the interplay of two or more of the major focus areas. A hardware or architecture component is not a necessary requirement for publication in ASPLOS: papers in both software and hardware areas are welcome. The program committee especially encourages research papers in non-traditional topics.
