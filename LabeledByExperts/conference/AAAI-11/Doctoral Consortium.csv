"'AAAI and ACM/SIGART invite students to apply for the Sixteenth AAAI/SIGART Doctoral Consortium. The Doctoral Consortium (DC) provides an opportunity for a group of Ph.D. students to discuss and explore their research interests and career objectives with a panel of established researchers in artificial intelligence. The consortium has the following objectives: (1) to provide a setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; (2) develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research; (3) support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on academic, research, industrial, and nontraditional career paths; and (4) contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and participation in conference events.",'1-2-2-1-2-1-1-2-2-2-2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,N
