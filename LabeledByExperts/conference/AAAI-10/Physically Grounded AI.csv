"'Robotics, computer vision, activity recognition, and the many other disciplines where computers interface to physical environments have proven to be a major source of inspiration and crucial new insights into artificial intelligence. Physical grounding provides ready access to a challenging, real problems of perception and action with rich source of data and the related stochastic effects. Further, applications of physically grounded AI have enormous potential to improve research, learning, entertainment, commerce, and society as a whole.",'1-2-2-1-1-1-2-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,N
