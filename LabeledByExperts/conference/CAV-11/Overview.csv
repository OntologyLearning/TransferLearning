"'CAV 2011 is the 23rd in a series dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems. CAV considers it vital to continue its leadership in hardware verification, maintain its recent momentum in software verification, and consider new domains such as biological systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. The proceedings of the conference will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.",'1-2-2-1-1-1-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,N
